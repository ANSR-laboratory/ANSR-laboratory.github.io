TI  - Functional connectivity associations with menstrual pain characteristics in 
      adolescents: an investigation of the triple network model.
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003334 [doi]
AB  - Menstrual pain is associated with deficits in central pain processing, yet 
      neuroimaging studies to date have all been limited by focusing on group 
      comparisons of adult women with vs without menstrual pain. This study aimed to 
      investigate the role of the triple network model (TNM) of brain networks in 
      adolescent girls with varied menstrual pain severity ratings. One hundred 
      participants (ages 13-19 years) completed a 6-min resting state functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan and rated menstrual pain severity, 
      menstrual pain interference, and cumulative menstrual pain exposure. Imaging 
      analyses included age and gynecological age (years since menarche) as covariates. 
      Menstrual pain severity was positively associated with functional connectivity 
      between the cingulo-opercular salience network (cSN) and the sensory processing 
      regions, limbic regions, and insula, and was also positively associated with 
      connectivity between the left central executive network (CEN) and posterior 
      regions. Menstrual pain interference was positively associated with connectivity 
      between the cSN and widespread brain areas. In addition, menstrual pain 
      interference was positively associated with connectivity within the left CEN, 
      whereas connectivity both within the right CEN and between the right CEN and 
      cortical areas outside the network (including the insula) were negatively 
      associated with menstrual pain interference. Cumulative menstrual pain exposure 
      shared a strong negative association with connectivity between the default mode 
      network and other widespread regions associated with large-scale brain networks. 
      These findings support a key role for the involvement of TNM brain networks in 
      menstrual pain characteristics and suggest that alterations in pain processing 
      exist in adolescents with varying levels of menstrual pain.

TI  - A network correspondence toolbox for quantitative evaluation of novel 
      neuroimaging results.

AB  - Decades of neuroscience research has shown that macroscale brain dynamics can be 
      reliably decomposed into a subset of large-scale functional networks, but the 
      specific spatial topographies of these networks and the names used to describe 
      them can vary across studies. Such discordance has hampered interpretation and 
      convergence of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we 
      have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to 
      examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging 
      results and sixteen widely used functional brain atlases, consistent with 
      recommended reporting standards developed by the Organization for Human Brain 
      Mapping. The atlases included in the toolbox show some topographical convergence 
      for specific networks, such as those labeled as default or visual. Network naming 
      varies across atlases, particularly for networks spanning frontoparietal 
      association cortices. For this reason, quantitative comparison with multiple 
      atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging findings. We provide 
      several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome Project task fMRI 
      results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to illustrate how 
      researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through quantitative 
      evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a convenient 
      means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine 
      the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined 
      maps and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to 
      incorporate additional atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make 
      it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a 
      standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons 
      between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.

AB  - The inequitable distribution of economic resources and exposure to adversity 
      between racial groups contributes to mental health disparities within the United 
      States. Consideration of the potential neurodevelopmental consequences, however, 
      has been limited particularly for neurocircuitry known to regulate the emotional 
      response to threat. Characterizing the consequences of inequity on threat 
      neurocircuitry is critical for robust and generalizable neurobiological models of 
      psychiatric illness. Here we use data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive 
      Development Study 4.0 release to investigate the contributions of individual and 
      neighborhood-level economic resources and exposure to discrimination. We 
      investigate the potential appearance of race-related differences using both 
      standard methods and through population-level normative modeling. We show that, 
      in a sample of white and Black adolescents, racial inequities in socioeconomic 
      factors largely contribute to the appearance of race-related differences in 
      cortical thickness of threat neurocircuitry. The race-related differences are 
      preserved through the use of population-level models and such models also 
      preserve associations between cortical thickness and specific socioeconomic 
      factors. The present findings highlight that such socioeconomic inequities 
      largely underlie race-related differences in brain morphology. The present 
      findings provide important new insight for the generation of generalizable 
      neurobiological models of psychiatric illness.

TI  - Association of Lower Rostral Anterior Cingulate GABA+ and Dysregulated Cortisol 
      Stress Response With Altered Functional Connectivity in Young Adults With 
      Lifetime Depression: A Multimodal Imaging Investigation of Trait and State 
      Effects.

LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.20230382 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preclinical work suggests that excess glucocorticoids and reduced 
      cortical γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may affect sex-dependent differences in brain 
      regions implicated in stress regulation and depressive phenotypes. The authors 
      sought to address a critical gap in knowledge, namely, how stress circuitry is 
      functionally affected by glucocorticoids and GABA in current or remitted major 
      depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: Multimodal imaging data were collected from 
      130 young adults (ages 18-25), of whom 44 had current MDD, 42 had remitted MDD, 
      and 44 were healthy comparison subjects. GABA+ (γ-aminobutyric acid and 
      macromolecules) was assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and 
      task-related functional MRI data were collected under acute stress and analyzed 
      using data-driven network modeling. RESULTS: Across modalities, trait-related 
      abnormalities emerged. Relative to healthy comparison subjects, both clinical 
      groups were characterized by lower rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) GABA+ 
      and frontoparietal network amplitude but higher amplitude in salience and 
      stress-related networks. For the remitted MDD group, differences from the healthy 
      comparison group emerged in the context of elevated cortisol levels, whereas the 
      MDD group had lower cortisol levels than the healthy comparison group. In the 
      comparison group, frontoparietal and stress-related network connectivity was 
      positively associated with cortisol level (highlighting putative top-down 
      regulation of stress), but the opposite relationship emerged in the MDD and 
      remitted MDD groups. Finally, rACC GABA+ was associated with stress-induced 
      changes in connectivity between overlapping default mode and salience networks. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime MDD was characterized by reduced rACC GABA+ as well as 
      dysregulated cortisol-related interactions between top-down control 
      (frontoparietal) and threat (task-related) networks. These findings warrant 
      further investigation of the role of GABA in the vulnerability to and treatment 
      of MDD.

AB  - Progress in scientific disciplines is accompanied by standardization of 
      terminology. Network neuroscience, at the level of macroscale organization of the 
      brain, is beginning to confront the challenges associated with developing a 
      taxonomy of its fundamental explanatory constructs. The Workgroup for HArmonized 
      Taxonomy of NETworks (WHATNET) was formed in 2020 as an Organization for Human 
      Brain Mapping (OHBM)-endorsed best practices committee to provide recommendations 
      on points of consensus, identify open questions, and highlight areas of ongoing 
      debate in the service of moving the field toward standardized reporting of 
      network neuroscience results. The committee conducted a survey to catalog current 
      practices in large-scale brain network nomenclature. A few well-known network 
      names (e.g., default mode network) dominated responses to the survey, and a 
      number of illuminating points of disagreement emerged. We summarize survey 
      results and provide initial considerations and recommendations from the 
      workgroup. This perspective piece includes a selective review of challenges to 
      this enterprise, including (1) network scale, resolution, and hierarchies; (2) 
      interindividual variability of networks; (3) dynamics and nonstationarity of 
      networks; (4) consideration of network affiliations of subcortical structures; 
      and (5) consideration of multimodal information. We close with minimal reporting 
      guidelines for the cognitive and network neuroscience communities to adopt.

TI  - Removal of site effects and enhancement of signal using dual projection 
      independent component analysis for pooling multi-site MRI data.
PG  - 3466-3487
LID - 10.1111/ejn.16120 [doi]
AB  - Combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from multi-site studies is a 
      popular approach for constructing larger datasets to greatly enhance the 
      reliability and reproducibility of neuroscience research. However, the 
      scanner/site variability is a significant confound that complicates the 
      interpretation of the results, so effective and complete removal of the 
      scanner/site variability is necessary to realise the full advantages of pooling 
      multi-site datasets. Independent component analysis (ICA) and general linear 
      model (GLM) based harmonisation methods are the two primary methods used to 
      eliminate scanner/site effects. Unfortunately, there are challenges with both 
      ICA-based and GLM-based harmonisation methods to remove site effects completely 
      when the signals of interest and scanner/site effects-related variables are 
      correlated, which may occur in neuroscience studies. In this study, we propose an 
      effective and powerful harmonisation strategy that implements dual projection 
      (DP) theory based on ICA to remove the scanner/site effects more completely. This 
      method can separate the signal effects correlated with site variables from the 
      identified site effects for removal without losing signals of interest. Both 
      simulations and vivo structural MRI datasets, including a dataset from Autism 
      Brain Imaging Data Exchange II and a travelling subject dataset from the 
      Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences, were used to test the performance 
      of a DP-based ICA harmonisation method. Results show that DP-based ICA 
      harmonisation has superior performance for removing site effects and enhancing 
      the sensitivity to detect signals of interest as compared with GLM-based and 
      conventional ICA harmonisation methods.

AB  - Modern neuroimaging studies frequently merge magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      data from multiple sites. A larger and more diverse group of participants can 
      increase the statistical power, enhance the reliability and reproducibility of 
      neuroimaging research, and obtain findings more representative of the general 
      population. However, measurement biases caused by site differences in scanners 
      represent a barrier when pooling data collected from different sites. The 
      existence of site effects can mask biological effects and lead to spurious 
      findings. We recently proposed a powerful denoising strategy that implements 
      dual-projection (DP) theory based on ICA to remove site-related effects from 
      pooled data, demonstrating the method for simulated and in vivo structural MRI 
      data. This study investigates the use of our DP-based ICA denoising method for 
      harmonizing functional MRI (fMRI) data collected from the Autism Brain Imaging 
      Data Exchange II. After frequency-domain and regional homogeneity analyses, two 
      modalities, including amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional 
      homogeneity (ReHo), were used to validate our method. The results indicate that 
      DP-based ICA denoising method removes unwanted site effects for both two fMRI 
      modalities, with increases in the significance of the associations between 
      non-imaging variables (age, sex, etc.) and fMRI measures. In conclusion, our DP 
      method can be applied to fMRI data in multi-site studies, enabling more accurate 
      and reliable neuroimaging research findings.

TI  - Deconstructing dissociation: a triple network model of trauma-related 
      dissociation and its subtypes.
PG  - 2261-2270

AB  - Trauma-related pathological dissociation is characterized by disruptions in one's 
      sense of self, perceptual, and affective experience. Dissociation and its 
      trauma-related antecedents disproportionately impact women. However, despite the 
      gender-related prevalence and high individual and societal costs, dissociation 
      remains widely underappreciated in clinical practice. Moreover, dissociation 
      lacks a synthesized neurobiological model across its subtypes. Leveraging the 
      Triple Network Model of psychopathology, we sought to parse heterogeneity in 
      dissociative experience by examining functional connectivity of three core 
      neurocognitive networks as related to: (1) the dimensional dissociation subtypes 
      of depersonalization/derealization and partially-dissociated intrusions; and, (2) 
      the diagnostic category of dissociative identity disorder (DID). Participants 
      were 91 women with and without: a history of childhood trauma, current 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and varied levels of dissociation. 
      Participants provided clinical data about dissociation, PTSD symptoms, childhood 
      maltreatment history, and completed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging scan. We used a novel statistical approach to assess both overlapping and 
      unique contributions of dissociation subtypes. Covarying for age, childhood 
      maltreatment and PTSD severity, we found dissociation was linked to 
      hyperconnectivity within central executive (CEN), default (DN), and salience 
      networks (SN), and decreased connectivity of CEN and SN with other areas. 
      Moreover, we isolated unique connectivity markers associated with 
      depersonalization/derealization in CEN and DN, to partially-dissociated 
      intrusions in CEN, and to DID in CEN. This suggests dissociation subtypes have 
      robust functional connectivity signatures that may serve as targets for PTSD/DID 
      treatment engagement. Our findings underscore dissociation assessment as crucial 
      in clinical care, in particular, to reduce gender-related health disparities.

AB  - Visual components of trauma memories are often vividly re-experienced by 
      survivors with deleterious consequences for normal function. Neuroimaging 
      research on trauma has primarily focused on threat-processing circuitry as core 
      to trauma-related dysfunction. Conversely, limited attention has been given to 
      visual circuitry which may be particularly relevant to posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD). Prior work suggests that the ventral visual stream is directly 
      related to the cognitive and affective disturbances observed in PTSD and may be 
      predictive of later symptom expression. The present study used multimodal 
      magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 278) collected two weeks after trauma 
      exposure from the AURORA study, a longitudinal, multisite investigation of 
      adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae. Indices of gray and white matter 
      were combined using data fusion to identify a structural covariance network (SCN) 
      of the ventral visual stream 2 weeks after trauma. Participant's loadings on the 
      SCN were positively associated with both intrusion symptoms and intensity of 
      nightmares. Further, SCN loadings moderated connectivity between a previously 
      observed amygdala-hippocampal functional covariance network and the inferior 
      temporal gyrus. Follow-up MRI data at 6 months showed an inverse relationship 
      between SCN loadings and negative alterations in cognition in mood. Further, 
      individuals who showed decreased strength of the SCN between 2 weeks and 6 months 
      had generally higher PTSD symptom severity over time. The present findings 
      highlight a role for structural integrity of the ventral visual stream in the 
      development of PTSD. The ventral visual stream may be particularly important for 
      the consolidation or retrieval of trauma memories and may contribute to efficient 
      reactivation of visual components of the trauma memory, thereby exacerbating PTSD 
      symptoms. Potentially chronic engagement of the network may lead to reduced 
      structural integrity which becomes a risk factor for lasting PTSD symptoms.

TI  - Individual Differences in Hemispheric Emotional Valence by Computerized Test 
      Correlate with Lateralized Differences in Nucleus Accumbens, Hippocampal and 
      Amygdala Volumes.
PG  - 1371-1384
LID - 10.2147/PRBM.S357138 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Conventional theories of hemispheric emotional valence (HEV) postulate 
      fixed hemispheric differences in emotional processing. Schiffer's dual brain 
      psychology proposes that there are prominent individual differences with a 
      substantial subset showing a reversed laterality pattern. He further proposed 
      that hemispheric differences were more akin to differences in personality than in 
      emotional processing. This theory is supported by findings that unilateral 
      treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, are effective if they 
      accurately target individual differences in laterality. The aim of this paper was 
      to assess if a computer test of hemispheric emotional valence (CTHEV) could 
      effectively identify individual differences in HEV and to ascertain if these 
      individual differences were associated with underlying differences in brain 
      structure and connectivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CTHEV was administered to 
      50 (18 male/32 female) right-handed participants, aged 18-19 years, enrolled in a 
      study assessing the neurobiological effects of childhood maltreatment. Based on a 
      literature review, we determined whether CTHEV correlated with lateralized 
      volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and subgenual anterior 
      cingulate as well as volume of the corpus callosum. RESULTS: CTHEV scores 
      correlated with laterality indices of the nucleus accumbens (p = 0.00016), 
      amygdala (p = 0.0138) and hippocampus (p = 0.031). A positive left hemispheric 
      valence was associated with a larger left-sided nucleus accumbens and hippocampus 
      and a smaller left amygdala. We identified four eigenvector network centrality 
      DTI measures that predict CTHEV, most notably the left amygdala, and found that 
      CTHEV results correlated with total and segment-specific corpus callosal volumes. 
      CONCLUSION: Individual differences in HEV can be readily assessed by computer 
      test and correlate with differences in brain structure and connectivity that 
      could provide a mechanistic understanding. These findings provide further support 
      for a revised understanding of HEV and provide a tool that could be used to guide 
      lateralized brain treatments.

AB  - The study of brain network interactions during naturalistic stimuli facilitates a 
      deeper understanding of human brain function. To estimate large-scale brain 
      networks evoked with naturalistic stimuli, a tensor component analysis (TCA) 
      based framework was used to characterize shared spatio-temporal patterns across 
      subjects in a purely data-driven manner. In this framework, a third-order tensor 
      is constructed from the timeseries extracted from all brain regions from a given 
      parcellation, for all participants, with modes of the tensor corresponding to 
      spatial distribution, time series and participants. TCA then reveals spatially 
      and temporally shared components, i.e., evoked networks with the naturalistic 
      stimuli, their time courses of activity and subject loadings of each component. 
      To enhance the reproducibility of the estimation with the adaptive TCA algorithm, 
      a novel spectral clustering method, tensor spectral clustering, was proposed and 
      applied to evaluate the stability of the TCA algorithm. We demonstrated the 
      effectiveness of the proposed framework via simulations and real fMRI data 
      collected during a motor task with a traditional fMRI study design. We also 
      applied the proposed framework to fMRI data collected during passive movie 
      watching to illustrate how reproducible brain networks are evoked by naturalistic 
      movie viewing.

AB  - The Triple Network Model of psychopathology identifies the salience network (SN), 
      central executive network (CEN), and default mode network (DMN) as key networks 
      underlying the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. In particular, abnormal 
      SN-initiated network switching impacts the engagement and disengagement of the 
      CEN and DMN, and is proposed to lead to the generation of psychosis symptoms. 
      Between-network connectivity has been shown to be abnormal in both substance use 
      disorders (SUD) and psychosis. However, none have studied how SUD affects 
      connectivity between sub-networks of the DMN, SN, and CEN in early stage 
      psychosis (ESP) patients. In this study, we collected data from 113 ESP patients 
      and 50 healthy controls to investigate the effect of SUD on between-network 
      connectivity. In addition, we performed sub-group analysis by exploring whether 
      past SUD vs current SUD co-morbidity, or diagnosis (affective vs non-affective 
      psychosis) had a modulatory effect. Connectivity between four network-pairs, 
      consisting of sub-networks of the SN, CEN, and DMN, was significantly different 
      between ESP patients and controls. Two patterns of connectivity were observed 
      when patients were divided into sub-groups with current vs past SUD. In 
      particular, connectivity between right CEN and the cingulo-opercular salience 
      sub-network (rCEN-CON) showed a gradient effect where the severity of 
      abnormalities increased from no history of SUD to past+ to current+. We also 
      observed diagnosis-specific effects, suggesting non-affective psychosis patients 
      were particularly vulnerable to effects of substance use on rCEN-CON 
      connectivity. Our findings reveal insights into how comorbid SUD affects 
      between-network connectivity and symptom severity in ESP.

TI  - Four-Week Mentalizing Imagery Therapy for Family Dementia Caregivers: A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial with Neural Circuit Changes.

LID - 10.1159/000521950 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Family caregivers of patients with dementia suffer a high burden of 
      depression and reduced positive emotions. Mentalizing imagery therapy (MIT) 
      provides mindfulness and guided imagery skills training to improve balanced 
      mentalizing and emotion regulation. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to test the 
      hypotheses that MIT for family caregivers would reduce depression symptoms and 
      improve positive psychological traits more than a support group (SG), and would 
      increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity and reduce subgenual 
      anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) connectivity. METHODS: Forty-six caregivers 
      participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week MIT group (n = 
      24) versus an SG (n = 22). Resting state neuroimaging was obtained at baseline 
      and post-group in 28 caregivers, and questionnaires completed by all 
      participants. The primary outcome was change in depression; secondary measures 
      included anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. Brain networks 
      with participation of DLPFC and sgACC were identified. Connectivity strengths of 
      DLPFC and sgACC with respective networks were determined with dual regression. 
      DLPFC connectivity was correlated with mindfulness and depression outcomes. 
      RESULTS: MIT significantly outperformed SG in improving depression, anxiety, 
      mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, with moderate to large effect 
      sizes. Relative to SG, participants in MIT showed significant increases in DLPFC 
      connectivity - exactly replicating pilot study results - but no change in sgACC. 
      DLPFC connectivity change correlated positively with mindfulness and negatively 
      with depression change. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, MIT was superior to SG for 
      reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and improving positive psychological 
      traits. Neuroimaging results suggested that strengthening DLPFC connectivity with 
      an emotion regulation network might be mechanistically related to MIT effects.

TI  - Perceived stress and rejection associated with functional network strength during 
      memory retrieval in adolescents.
PG  - 99-112
LID - 10.1080/17588928.2022.2026313 [doi]
AB  - The brain undergoes substantial structural and functional remodeling during 
      adolescence, including alterations in memory-processing regions influenced by 
      stress. This study evaluated brain activation using functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) during spatial memory performance using a virtual Morris water 
      task (MWT) and examined the associations between default mode network (DMN) 
      activation, task performance, and perceived stress and rejection. Functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at 3 Tesla from 59 (34 female) 
      adolescents (13-14 years). The NIH Emotion Toolbox was used to measure perceived 
      stress and rejection. During the MWT, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex showed 
      greater activation during memory retrieval relative to motor performance. 
      Templates of brain functional networks from the Human Connectome Project study 
      were used to extract individual participants' brain network activation strengths 
      for the retrieval > motor contrast for two sub-networks of the default mode 
      network: medial temporal lobe (MTL-DMN) and dorsomedial prefrontal (dMPFC-DMN). 
      For the MTL-DMN sub-network only, activation was significantly associated with 
      worse MWT performance (p = .008) and greater perceived stress (p = .008) and 
      perceived rejection (p = .002). Further, MWT performance was negatively 
      associated with perceived rejection (p = .007). These findings suggest that 
      perceived stress and rejection are related to engagement of MTL-DMN during 
      spatial memory and that engagement of this network impacts performance. These 
      findings also demonstrate the utility of examining task-related network 
      activation strength to identify the impact of perceived stress and rejection on 
      large-scale brain network functioning during adolescence.

TI  - Large-scale brain network activation during emotional inhibitory control: 
      Associations with alcohol misuse in college freshmen.
PG  - 410-421
LID - 10.1111/acer.14782 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The transition to college is associated with increased risk of 
      alcohol misuse and a consequent increase in negative, alcohol-related social and 
      health impacts. Traits associated with ongoing brain maturation during this 
      period, including impulsivity in emotional contexts, could contribute to risky 
      alcohol use. METHODS: This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study 
      examined brain network activation strength during an emotional inhibitory control 
      task (Go-NoGo), which required participants to ignore background images with 
      negative or neutral emotional valence during performance. Participants were 60 
      college freshmen (aged 18-20 years, 33 women). Survey measures, completed at 
      baseline and one-year follow-up (follow-up n = 52, 29 women), assessed alcohol 
      misuse alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT), alcohol/substance use 
      counseling center assessment of psychological symptoms (C-CAPS), and negative 
      consequences of alcohol use young adult alcohol consequences questionnaire 
      (YAACQ). Measures were examined relative to network activation strength, on the 
      Negative NoGo > Neutral NoGo contrast, of four large-scale brain networks 
      implicated in top-down regulation of cognition and attention: right and left 
      lateral frontoparietal networks (rL-FPN; lL-FPN), dorsal attention network (DAN), 
      and salience network (SN). RESULTS: Activation strength of DAN was negatively 
      associated with scores on the AUDIT (p = 0.013) and YAACQ (p = 0.004) at 
      baseline, and with C-CAPS score at baseline and follow-up (p = 0.002; p = 0.005), 
      and positively associated with accuracy on NoGo trials with negative backgrounds 
      (p = 0.014). Activation strength of rL-FPN was positively associated with C-CAPS 
      score at follow-up (p = 0.003). SN activation strength was negatively associated 
      with accuracy on NoGo trials with negative (p < 0.001) and neutral (p = 0.002) 
      backgrounds and with the accuracy difference between negative versus neutral NoGo 
      trials (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that less engagement of 
      large-scale brain circuitry that supports top-down attentional control, 
      specifically during negative emotions, is associated with more problematic 
      drinking in emerging adults who attend college. This pattern of network 
      activation may serve as a risk marker for ongoing self-regulation deficits during 
      negative emotion that could increase risk of problematic alcohol use and negative 
      impacts of drinking.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by increased stress sensitivity. 
      Emerging findings in healthy adults suggest that stress responses within 
      limbic/striatal-prefrontal regions are moderated by sex and unfold over time. 
      Thus, we hypothesized that stress response abnormalities in MDD might be affected 
      by sex and stress exposure time. The Montreal Imaging Stress Task was 
      administered to 124 unmedicated patients with first-episode MDD (76 females) and 
      243 healthy controls (HC; 137 females) during functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI). Based on prior studies, amygdala, hippocampus, medial 
      orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex (dlPFC) were selected as a priori regions of interest. In a complementary 
      approach, we probed the effects of stress on the frontoparietal network (FPN) and 
      a network including the amygdala, NAc and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Across 
      groups, males exhibited higher dlPFC activity and right FPN amplitude than 
      females. Relative to female HCs, the female MDD group had less deactivation in 
      limbic/striatal regions (amygdala, NAc, hippocampus, Amygdala-NAc-ACC network). 
      Furthermore, unlike female HCs, the female MDD group failed to show a significant 
      increase of deactivation over stress exposure time in the amygdala, mOFC and NAc. 
      Our findings confirm the importance of considering sex differences when 
      investigating neural stress responses. Case-control differences in neural stress 
      responses observed in females (but not males) provide insights into sex 
      differences in the etiology and pathophysiology of depression. The failure to 
      deactivate limbic/NAc regions in depressed females point to dysfunction of 
      adaptive stress responses over stress exposure time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family dementia caregivers experience high rates of depression and 
      anxiety that often go untreated due to time demands. We aimed to determine the 
      feasibility of a brief, 4-week Mentalizing Imagery Therapy intervention, which 
      couples mindfulness with guided imagery practices aimed at bolstering mentalizing 
      capacity, to reduce caregiver psychological symptoms and to explore potential 
      impact on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity. METHODS: Twenty-four 
      family dementia caregivers with moderate depression symptoms (a score of 10 in 
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9) were assigned to either group Mentalizing Imagery 
      Therapy (MIT, n = 12) or a waitlist augmented by optional relaxation exercises (n 
      = 12). Participants completed questionnaires to measure depression and anxiety at 
      baseline and followup, and those eligible also underwent resting state functional 
      magnetic resonance (fMRI) brain imaging at these time points. RESULTS: Eleven of 
      12 caregivers assigned to MIT completed the intervention and attended weekly 
      groups 98% of the time. MIT home practice logs indicated average practice of 5 ± 
      2 sessions per week for 23 ± 8 min per session. All participants in waitlist 
      completed the post-assessment. MIT participants exhibited significantly greater 
      improvement than waitlist on self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms 
      (p<.05) after 4 weeks. Neuroimaging results revealed increased dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex connectivity with a putative emotion regulation network in the 
      MIT group (p = .05) but not in waitlist (p = 1.0). LIMITATIONS: Sample size 
      limitations necessitate validation of findings in larger, randomized controlled 
      trials. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week group MIT program was feasible for caregivers, with 
      high levels of participation in weekly group meetings and home practice 
      exercises.

TI  - Reductions in rostral anterior cingulate GABA are associated with stress 
      circuitry in females with major depression: a multimodal imaging investigation.
PG  - 2188-2196
LID - 10.1038/s41386-021-01127-x [doi]
AB  - The interplay between cortical and limbic regions in stress circuitry calls for a 
      neural systems approach to investigations of acute stress responses in major 
      depressive disorder (MDD). Advances in multimodal imaging allow inferences 
      between regional neurotransmitter function and activation in circuits linked to 
      MDD, which could inform treatment development. The current study investigated the 
      role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in stress circuitry in females with 
      current and remitted MDD. Multimodal imaging data were analyzed from 49 young 
      female adults across three groups (current MDD, remitted MDD (rMDD), and healthy 
      controls). GABA was assessed at baseline using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 
      and functional MRI data were collected before, during, and after an acute 
      stressor and analyzed using a network modeling approach. The MDD group showed an 
      overall lower cortisol response than the rMDD group and lower rostral anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA than healthy controls. Across groups, stress 
      decreased activation in the frontoparietal network (FPN) but increased activation 
      in the default mode network (DMN) and a network encompassing the ventromedial 
      prefrontal cortex-striatum-anterior cingulate cortex (vmPFC-Str-ACC). Relative to 
      controls, the MDD and rMDD groups were characterized by decreased FPN and 
      salience network (SN) activation overall. Rostral ACC GABA was positively 
      associated with connectivity between an overlapping limbic network 
      (Temporal-Insula-Amygdala) and two other circuits (FPN and DMN). Collectively, 
      these findings indicate that reduced GABA in females with MDD was associated with 
      connectivity differences within and across key networks implicated in depression. 
      GABAergic treatments for MDD might alleviate stress circuitry abnormalities in 
      females.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been 
      made based on symptoms. Extensive studies have demonstrated that PD may lead to 
      variation of brain activity in different frequency bands. However, frequency 
      specific dynamic alterations of PD have not yet been explored. NEW METHOD: In 
      order to address this gap, a novel sparse nonnegative tensor decomposition (SNTD) 
      method was used to estimate frequency specific co-activation patterns (CAP). The 
      difference between PD and healthy controls (HC) are investigated with the 
      proposed framework. RESULT: The difference between PD and HC mainly exists at 
      frequency band 0.04-0.1 Hz in basal ganglia. We also found that the average 
      intensity of PD in this frequency band is significantly correlated with the Hoehn 
      and Yahr scale. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Compared with conventional CAP 
      approach, SNTD estimates frequency specific CAPs that show alterations in PD 
      patients. CONCLUSION: SNTD provides an alternative to K-means clustering used in 
      conventional CAP analysis. With the proposed framework, frequency specific CAPs 
      are extracted, and alterations in PD patients are also successfully discovered.

TI  - Identifying Subgroups of Major Depressive Disorder Using Brain Structural 
      Covariance Networks and Mapping of Associated Clinical and Cognitive Variables.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying data-driven subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD) 
      holds promise for parsing the heterogeneity of MDD in a neurobiologically 
      informed way. However, limited studies have used brain structural covariance 
      networks (SCNs) for subtyping MDD. METHODS: This study included 145 unmedicated 
      patients with MDD and 206 demographically matched healthy control subjects, who 
      underwent a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan and a comprehensive 
      neurocognitive battery. Patterns of structural covariance were identified using 
      source-based morphometry across both patients with MDD and healthy control 
      subjects. K-means clustering algorithms were applied on dysregulated structural 
      networks in MDD to identify potential MDD subtypes. Finally, clinical and 
      neurocognitive measures were compared between identified subgroups to elucidate 
      the profile of these MDD subtypes. RESULTS: Source-based morphometry across all 
      individuals identified 28 whole-brain SCNs that encompassed the prefrontal, 
      anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices; basal ganglia; and cerebellar, 
      visual, and motor regions. Compared with healthy control subjects, individuals 
      with MDD showed lower structural network integrity in three networks including 
      default mode, ventromedial prefrontal cortical, and salience networks. Clustering 
      analysis revealed two MDD subtypes based on the patterns of structural network 
      abnormalities in these three networks. Further profiling revealed that patients 
      in subtype 1 had younger age of onset and more symptom severity as well as 
      greater deficits in cognitive performance than patients in subtype 2. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we identified two MDD subtypes based on SCNs that differed 
      in their clinical and cognitive profile. Our results represent a proof-of-concept 
      framework for leveraging these large-scale SCNs to parse heterogeneity in MDD.

TI  - Abnormal Brain Bioenergetics in First-Episode Psychosis.
PG  - sgaa073
LID - 10.1093/schizbullopen/sgaa073 [doi]
LID - sgaa073
AB  - BACKGROUND: Converging evidence indicates impaired brain energy metabolism in 
      schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Creatine kinase (CK) is pivotal in 
      providing adenosine triphosphate in the cell and maintaining its levels when 
      energy demand is increased. However, the activity of CK has not been investigated 
      in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHODS: Using 
      in vivo phosphorus magnetization transfer spectroscopy, we measured CK 
      first-order forward rate constant (k (f) ) in the frontal lobe, in patients with 
      first-episode psychosis (FEP; n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 34), at rest. 
      RESULTS: CK k (f) was significantly reduced in FEP compared to healthy controls. 
      There were no differences in other energy metabolism-related measures, including 
      phosphocreatine (PCr) or ATP, between groups. We also found increase in 
      glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine, a putative membrane breakdown product, in patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that brain bioenergetic 
      abnormalities are already present early in the course of schizophrenia spectrum 
      disorders. Future research is needed to identify the relationship of reduced CK k 
      (f) with psychotic symptoms and to test treatment alternatives targeting this 
      pathway. Increased glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine is consistent with earlier 
      studies in medication-naïve patients and later studies in first-episode 
      schizophrenia, and suggest enhanced synaptic pruning.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disorder that interferes with 
      daily functioning, and that occurs at higher rates in women than in men. 
      Structural and functional alterations in hippocampus and frontal lobe have been 
      reported in MDD, which likely contribute to the multifaceted nature of MDD. One 
      area impacted by MDD is hippocampal-mediated memory, which can be probed using a 
      spatial virtual Morris water task (MWT). Women (n=24) across a spectrum of 
      depression severity underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during 
      MWT. Depression severity, assessed via Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), was 
      examined relative to brain activation during task performance. Significant brain 
      activation was evident in areas traditionally implicated in spatial memory 
      processing, including right hippocampus and frontal lobe regions, for retrieval > 
      motor contrast. When BDI was included as a regressor, significantly less 
      functional activation was evident in left hippocampus, and other non-frontal, 
      task relevant regions for retrieval > rest contrast. Consistent with previous 
      studies, depression severity was associated with functional alterations observed 
      during spatial memory performance. These findings may contribute to understanding 
      neurobiological underpinnings of depression severity and associated memory 
      impairments, which may have implications for treatment approaches aimed at 
      alleviating effects of depression in women.

TI  - Snowball ICA: A Model Order Free Independent Component Analysis Strategy for 
      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data.
PG  - 569657
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2020.569657 [doi]
LID - 569657
AB  - In independent component analysis (ICA), the selection of model order (i.e., 
      number of components to be extracted) has crucial effects on functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) brain network analysis. Model order selection (MOS) 
      algorithms have been used to determine the number of estimated components. 
      However, simulations show that even when the model order equals the number of 
      simulated signal sources, traditional ICA algorithms may misestimate the spatial 
      maps of the signal sources. In principle, increasing model order will consider 
      more potential information in the estimation, and should therefore produce more 
      accurate results. However, this strategy may not work for fMRI because 
      large-scale networks are widely spatially distributed and thus have increased 
      mutual information with noise. As such, conventional ICA algorithms with high 
      model orders may not extract these components at all. This conflict makes the 
      selection of model order a problem. We present a new strategy for model order 
      free ICA, called Snowball ICA, that obviates these issues. The algorithm collects 
      all information for each network from fMRI data without the limitations of 
      network scale. Using simulations and in vivo resting-state fMRI data, our results 
      show that component estimation using Snowball ICA is more accurate than 
      traditional ICA. The Snowball ICA software is available at 
      https://github.com/GHu-DUT/Snowball-ICA.

TI  - Acute Posttraumatic Symptoms Are Associated With Multimodal Neuroimaging 
      Structural Covariance Patterns: A Possible Role for the Neural Substrates of 
      Visual Processing in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aspects of brain morphology have been associated with 
      chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), limited work has investigated 
      multimodal patterns in brain morphology that are linked to acute posttraumatic 
      stress severity. In the present study, we utilized multimodal magnetic resonance 
      imaging to investigate if structural covariance networks (SCNs) assessed acutely 
      following trauma were linked to acute posttraumatic stress severity. METHODS: 
      Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were collected around 1 month after 
      civilian trauma exposure in 78 participants. Multimodal magnetic resonance 
      imaging data fusion was completed to identify combinations of SCNs, termed 
      structural covariance profiles (SCPs), related to acute posttraumatic stress 
      severity collected at 1 month. Analyses assessed the relationship between 
      participant SCP loadings, acute posttraumatic stress severity, the change in 
      posttraumatic stress severity from 1 to 12 months, and depressive symptoms. 
      RESULTS: We identified an SCP that reflected greater gray matter properties of 
      the anterior temporal lobe, fusiform face area, and visual cortex (i.e., the 
      ventral visual stream) that varied curvilinearly with acute posttraumatic stress 
      severity and the change in PTSD symptom severity from 1 to 12 months. The SCP was 
      not associated with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We identified combinations 
      of multimodal SCNs that are related to variability in PTSD symptoms in the early 
      aftermath of trauma. The identified SCNs may reflect patterns of neuroanatomical 
      organization that provide unique insight into acute posttraumatic stress. 
      Furthermore, these multimodal SCNs may be potential candidates for neural markers 
      of susceptibility to both acute posttraumatic stress and the future development 
      of PTSD.

AB  - Pooling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across research studies, or 
      utilizing shared data from imaging repositories, presents exceptional 
      opportunities to advance and enhance reproducibility of neuroscience research. 
      However, scanner confounds hinder pooling data collected on different scanners or 
      across software and hardware upgrades on the same scanner, even when all 
      acquisition protocols are harmonized. These confounds reduce power and can lead 
      to spurious findings. Unfortunately, methods to address this problem are scant. 
      In this study, we propose a novel denoising approach that implements a 
      data-driven linked independent component analysis (LICA) to identify 
      scanner-related effects for removal from multimodal MRI to denoise scanner 
      effects. We utilized multi-study data to test our proposed method that were 
      collected on a single 3T scanner, pre- and post-software and major hardware 
      upgrades and using different acquisition parameters. Our proposed denoising 
      method shows a greater reduction of scanner-related variance compared with 
      standard GLM confound regression or ICA-based single-modality denoising. Although 
      we did not test it here, for combining data across different scanners, LICA 
      should prove even better at identifying scanner effects as between-scanner 
      variability is generally much larger than within-scanner variability. Our method 
      has great promise for denoising scanner effects in multi-study and in large-scale 
      multi-site studies that may be confounded by scanner differences.

TI  - Craving and Cue Reactivity in Nicotine-Dependent Tobacco Smokers Is Associated 
      With Different Insula Networks.
PG  - 76-83
LID - S2451-9022(19)30246-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.bpsc.2019.09.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The insula has a well-established role in nicotine dependence and is 
      a node of the salience network, which integrates internal and external 
      information to guide behavior. Recent findings reveal that internal and external 
      processing occurs in the ventral anterior insula (vAI) and dorsal anterior insula 
      (dAI), respectively. Whether vAI/dAI network connectivity differentially reflects 
      internally generated craving and externally triggered smoking cue reactivity was 
      tested. METHODS: Thirty-six male and female nicotine-dependent individuals smoked 
      1 hour before functional magnetic resonance imaging. Baseline craving was 
      measured, followed by resting-state and smoking cue reactivity scans and then 
      another assessment of craving. Craving and cue reactivity interactions were 
      measured by focusing on specific nodes of the salience network: the vAI/dAI and 
      anterior cingulate cortex. RESULTS: Resting-state vAI/dAI networks overlapped 
      with the prototypical salience network, yet they possessed distinct patterns, 
      linking the vAI with nodes of the internally focused default mode network and the 
      dAI with nodes of the external, goal-related frontoparietal network. Internally 
      generated baseline craving was associated with enhanced vAI connectivity, whereas 
      rostral anterior cingulate cortex reactivity to external smoking cues was 
      associated with greater dAI connectivity. We also found that cue reactivity in 
      the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was associated with a rise in subjective 
      cue-induced craving, whereas baseline subjective craving did not influence brain 
      cue reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that brain reactivity to smoking 
      cues is associated with a subsequent increase in craving. In addition, separate 
      insula networks have a role in an individual's vulnerability to internally 
      related craving and externally triggered cue reactivity, which could guide the 
      development of new, neurobiologically targeted therapies.

TI  - Morphometric Biomarkers of Adolescents With Familial Risk for Alcohol Use 
      Disorder.
PG  - 2354-2366
LID - 10.1111/acer.14201 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While many adolescents exhibit risky behavior, teenagers with a 
      family history (FH+) of an alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at a heightened risk 
      for earlier initiation of alcohol use, a more rapid escalation in frequency and 
      quantity of alcohol consumption and developing a subsequent AUD in comparison 
      with youth without such family history (FH-). Neuroanatomically, developmentally 
      normative risk-taking behavior parallels an imbalance between more protracted 
      development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and earlier development of limbic 
      regions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived volumetric properties were 
      obtained for these structures in FH+ and FH- adolescents. METHODS: Forty-two 
      substance-naïve adolescents (13- to 14-year-olds), stratified into FH+ (N = 19, 
      13 girls) and FH- (N = 23, 11 girls) age/handedness-matched groups, completed MRI 
      scanning at 3.0T, as well as cognitive and clinical testing. T1 images were 
      processed using FreeSurfer to measure PFC and hippocampi/amygdalae 
      subfields/nuclei volumes. RESULTS: FH+ status was associated with larger 
      hippocampal/amygdala volumes (p < 0.05), relative to FH- adolescents, with right 
      amygdala results appearing to be driven by FH+ boys. Volumetric differences also 
      were positively associated with family history density (p < 0.05) of having an 
      AUD. Larger subfields/nuclei volumes were associated with higher anxiety levels 
      and worse auditory verbal learning performance (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: FH+ risk 
      for AUD is detectable via neuromorphometric characteristics, which precede 
      alcohol use onset and the potential onset of a later AUD, that are associated 
      with emotional and cognitive measures. It is plausible that the development of 
      limbic regions might be altered in FH+ youth, even prior to the onset of alcohol 
      use, which could increase later risk. Thus, targeted preventative measures are 
      warranted that serve to delay the onset of alcohol use in youth, particularly in 
      those who are FH+ for an AUD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stability of spatial components is frequently used as a post-hoc 
      selection criteria for choosing the dimensionality of an independent component 
      analysis (ICA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Although the 
      stability of the ICA temporal courses differs from that of spatial components, 
      temporal stability has not been considered during dimensionality decisions. NEW 
      METHOD: The current study aims to (1) develop an algorithm to incorporate 
      temporal course stability into dimensionality selection and (2) test the impact 
      of temporal course on the stability of the ICA decomposition of fMRI data via 
      tensor clustering. Resting state fMRI data were analyzed with two popular ICA 
      algorithms, InfomaxICA and FastICA, using our new method and results were 
      compared with model order selection based on spatial or temporal criteria alone. 
      RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering indicated that the stability of the ICA 
      decomposition incorporating spatiotemporal tensor information performed similarly 
      when compared to current best practice. However, we found that component 
      spatiotemporal stability and convergence of the model varied significantly with 
      model order. Considering both may lead to methodological improvements for 
      determining ICA model order. Selected components were also significantly 
      associated with relevant behavioral variables. Comparison with Existing Method: 
      The Kullback-Leibler information criterion algorithm suggests the optimal model 
      order for group ICA is 40, compared to the proposed method with an optimal model 
      order of 20. CONCLUSION: The current study sheds new light on the importance of 
      temporal course variability in ICA of fMRI data.

AB  - Patients with schizophrenia show impairment in processing faces, including facial 
      affect and face detection, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We used 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize resting state 
      functional connectivity between an independent component analysis (ICA)-defined 
      early visual cortical network (corresponding to regions in V1, V2, V3) and a 
      priori defined face-processing regions (fusiform face area [FFA], occipital face 
      area [OFA], superior temporal sulcus [STS] and amygdala) using dual regression in 
      20 schizophrenia patients and 26 healthy controls. We also investigated the 
      association between resting functional connectivity and neural responses (fMRI) 
      elicited by a face detection paradigm in a partially overlapping sample (Maher et 
      al., 2016) that used stimuli equated for lower-level perceptual abilities. Group 
      differences in functional connectivity were found in right FFA only; controls 
      showed significantly stronger functional connectivity to an early visual cortical 
      network. Functional connectivity in right FFA was associated with (a) neural 
      responses during face detection in controls only, and (b) perceptual detection 
      thresholds for faces in patients only. The finding of impaired functional 
      connectivity for right FFA (but not other queried domain-specific regions) 
      converges with findings investigating face detection in an overlapping sample in 
      which dysfunction was found exclusively for right FFA in schizophrenia during 
      face detection.

AB  - There have been many recent reports highlighting a crisis in replication and 
      reliability of research in psychology, neuroscience, and neuroimaging. After a 
      series of reports uncovered various methodological problems with functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research, considerable attention has been given 
      to principles and practices to improve reproducibility of neuroimaging findings, 
      including promotion of openness, transparency, and data sharing. However, much 
      less attention has been given to use of open access neuroimaging datasets to 
      conduct replication studies. A major barrier to reproducing neuroimaging studies 
      is their high cost, in money and labor, and utilizing such datasets is an obvious 
      solution for breaking down this barrier. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is an 
      open access dataset consisting of extensive neurological, behavioral, and 
      genetics assessments and neuroimaging data from over 1,100 individuals. In the 
      present study, findings supporting the replication of a highly cited neuroimaging 
      study that showed correspondence between resting state and task brain networks, 
      and novel findings on activation of brain networks during task performance that 
      arose with this exercise are presented as a demonstration of use of the HCP for 
      replication studies.

AB  - The frontal cortex undergoes substantial structural and functional changes during 
      adolescence and significant developmental changes also occur in the hippocampus. 
      Both of these regions are notably vulnerable to alcohol and other substance use, 
      which is typically initiated during adolescence. Identifying measures of brain 
      function during adolescence, particularly before initiation of drug or alcohol 
      use, is critical to understanding how such behaviors may affect brain 
      development, especially in these vulnerable brain regions. While there is a 
      substantial developmental literature on adolescent working memory, less is known 
      about spatial memory. Thus, a virtual Morris water task (vMWT) was applied to 
      probe function of the adolescent hippocampus. Multiband blood oxygen level 
      dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired 
      at 3T during task performance. Participants included 32 healthy, alcohol- and 
      drug-naïve adolescents, 13-14 years old, examined at baseline of a 3-year 
      longitudinal MRI study. Significantly greater BOLD activation was observed in the 
      hippocampus and surrounding areas, and in prefrontal regions involved in 
      executive function, during retrieval relative to motor performance. In contrast, 
      significantly greater BOLD activation was observed in components of the default 
      mode network, including frontal medial cortex, during the motor condition (when 
      task demands were minimal) relative to the retrieval condition. Worse performance 
      (longer path length) during retrieval was associated with greater activation of 
      angular gyrus/supramarginal gyrus, whereas worse performance (longer path 
      length/latency) during motor control was associated with less activation of 
      frontal pole. Furthermore, while latency (time to complete task) was greater in 
      females than in males, there were no sex differences in path length (accuracy), 
      suggesting that females required more time to navigate the virtual environment, 
      but did so as effectively as males. These findings demonstrate that performance 
      of the vMWT elicits hippocampal and prefrontal activation patterns in early 
      adolescence, similar to activation observed during spatial memory retrieval in 
      adults. Given that this task is sensitive to hippocampal function, and that the 
      adolescent hippocampus is notably vulnerable to the effects of alcohol and other 
      substances, data acquired using this task during healthy adolescent development 
      may provide a framework for understanding neurobiological impact of later 
      initiation of use.

LID - e0199049
AB  - Focusing on sex differences is necessary to fully understand basic 
      neurobiological processes such as the engagement of large-scale brain networks 
      involved in attention. Prior work suggests that women show enhanced attention 
      during tasks of reward/punishment relative to men. Yet, sex differences in the 
      engagement of neural networks sub serving internal and external focus has been 
      unexplored in regard to reward and punishment. Using data from a large sample (n 
      = 190) of healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project, we investigated 
      sex differences in default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), 
      and frontal parietal network (FPN) activation during exposure to reward and 
      punishment. To determine if sex differences are specific to valenced stimuli, we 
      analyzed network activation during working memory. Results indicate that, 
      relative to men, women have increased suppression of the DMN and greater 
      activation of the DAN during exposure to reward and punishment. Given the 
      relative roles of these networks in internal (DMN) and external (DAN) attention, 
      this pattern of activation suggests that women have enhanced external attention 
      to reward and punishment. In contrast, there were no sex differences in network 
      activation during working memory, indicating that this sex difference is specific 
      to the processing of reward and punishment. These findings suggest a 
      neurobiological explanation for prior work showing women have greater sensitivity 
      to reward/punishment and are more prone to psychiatric disorders characterized by 
      enhanced attention to such stimuli. Furthermore, given the large sample from the 
      Human Connectome Project, the current findings provide general implications for 
      the study of sex as a biological variable in investigation of reward processes.

TI  - College Binge Drinking Associated with Decreased Frontal Activation to Negative 
      Emotional Distractors during Inhibitory Control.

AB  - The transition to college is associated with an increase in heavy episodic 
      alcohol use, or binge drinking, during a time when the prefrontal cortex and 
      prefrontal-limbic circuitry continue to mature. Traits associated with this 
      immaturity, including impulsivity in emotional contexts, may contribute to risky 
      and heavy episodic alcohol consumption. The current study used blood oxygen level 
      dependent (BOLD) multiband functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess 
      brain activation during a task that required participants to ignore background 
      images with positive, negative, or neutral emotional valence while performing an 
      inhibitory control task (Go-NoGo). Subjects were 23 college freshmen (seven male, 
      18-20 years) who engaged in a range of drinking behavior (past 3 months' binge 
      episodes range = 0-19, mean = 4.6, total drinks consumed range = 0-104, mean = 
      32.0). Brain activation on inhibitory trials (NoGo) was contrasted between 
      negative and neutral conditions and between positive and neutral conditions using 
      non-parametric testing (5000 permutations) and cluster-based thresholding (z = 
      2.3), p ≤ 0.05 corrected. Results showed that a higher recent incidence of binge 
      drinking was significantly associated with decreased activation of dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC), brain regions strongly implicated in executive 
      functioning, during negative relative to neutral inhibitory trials. No 
      significant associations between binge drinking and brain activation were 
      observed for positive relative to neutral images. While task performance was not 
      significantly associated with binge drinking in this sample, subjects with 
      heavier recent binge drinking showed decreased recruitment of executive control 
      regions under negative versus neutral distractor conditions. These findings 
      suggest that in young adults with heavier recent binge drinking, processing of 
      negative emotional images interferes more with inhibitory control neurocircuitry 
      than in young adults who do not binge drink often. This pattern of altered 
      frontal lobe activation associated with binge drinking may serve as an early 
      marker of risk for future self-regulation deficits that could lead to problematic 
      alcohol use. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the impact 
      of emotion on cognitive control and associated brain functioning in binge 
      drinking behaviors among young adults.

TI  - Emotional intelligence is associated with connectivity within and between resting 
      state networks.
PG  - 1624-1636

AB  - Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined as an individual's capacity to accurately 
      perceive, understand, reason about, and regulate emotions, and to apply that 
      information to facilitate thought and achieve goals. Although EI plays an 
      important role in mental health and success in academic, professional and social 
      realms, the neurocircuitry underlying this capacity remains poorly characterized, 
      and no study to date has yet examined the relationship between EI and intrinsic 
      neural network function. Here, in a sample of 54 healthy individuals (28 women, 
      26 men), we apply independent components analysis (ICA) with dual regression to 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired while subjects were 
      resting in the scanner to investigate brain circuits (intrinsic resting state 
      networks) whose activity is associated with greater self-reported (i.e. Trait) 
      and objectively measured (i.e. Ability) EI. We show that higher Ability EI, but 
      not Trait EI, is associated with stronger negatively correlated spontaneous fMRI 
      signals between the basal ganglia/limbic network (BGN) and posterior default mode 
      network (DMN), and regions involved in emotional processing and regulation. 
      Importantly, these findings suggest that the functional connectivity within and 
      between intrinsic networks associated with mentation, affective regulation, 
      emotion processing, and reward are strongly related to ability EI.

AB  - Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is one of the most popular techniques for 
      the analysis of resting state FMRI data because it has several advantageous 
      properties when compared with other techniques. Most notably, in contrast to a 
      conventional seed-based correlation analysis, it is model-free and multivariate, 
      thus switching the focus from evaluating the functional connectivity of single 
      brain regions identified a priori to evaluating brain connectivity in terms of 
      all brain resting state networks (RSNs) that simultaneously engage in oscillatory 
      activity. Furthermore, typical seed-based analysis characterizes RSNs in terms of 
      spatially distributed patterns of correlation (typically by means of simple 
      Pearson's coefficients) and thereby confounds together amplitude information of 
      oscillatory activity and noise. ICA and other regression techniques, on the other 
      hand, retain magnitude information and therefore can be sensitive to both changes 
      in the spatially distributed nature of correlations (differences in the spatial 
      pattern or "shape") as well as the amplitude of the network activity. 
      Furthermore, motion can mimic amplitude effects so it is crucial to use a 
      technique that retains such information to ensure that connectivity differences 
      are accurately localized. In this work, we investigate the dual regression 
      approach that is frequently applied with group ICA to assess group differences in 
      resting state functional connectivity of brain networks. We show how ignoring 
      amplitude effects and how excessive motion corrupts connectivity maps and results 
      in spurious connectivity differences. We also show how to implement the dual 
      regression to retain amplitude information and how to use dual regression outputs 
      to identify potential motion effects. Two key findings are that using a technique 
      that retains magnitude information, e.g., dual regression, and using strict 
      motion criteria are crucial for controlling both network amplitude and 
      motion-related amplitude effects, respectively, in resting state connectivity 
      analyses. We illustrate these concepts using realistic simulated resting state 
      FMRI data and in vivo data acquired in healthy subjects and patients with bipolar 
      disorder and schizophrenia.

TI  - Disruption of white matter structural integrity and connectivity in posttraumatic 
      stress disorder: A TBSS and tractography study.
PG  - 437-445
LID - 10.1002/da.22615 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies of brain white matter (WM) in posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) have focused on combat trauma, and often were confounded by 
      neurological and substance dependence comorbidity. This study used tract-based 
      spatial statistics (TBSS) and probabilistic tractography to characterize WM 
      microstructure in a mixed-sex community sample of PTSD patients exposed to 
      diverse and multiple traumas, and in trauma-exposed normal comparison (TENC) 
      subjects. METHODS: TBSS compared diffusion measures between 20 adults with DSM-IV 
      PTSD and 17 TENC, using a whole-brain voxel-wise approach. Probabilistic 
      tractography using Freesurfer's TRACULA was employed to measure diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) metrics within anatomically defined pathways. DTI metrics were 
      compared between groups and correlated with PTSD symptom severity and trauma 
      load. RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, and motion, PTSD subjects had 
      significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in a left frontal lobe cluster 
      compared with TENC, at p < .05, family-wise error corrected. Tractography 
      identified significant group differences in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus 
      (ILF), including lower FA and higher radial diffusivity in PTSD compared with 
      TENC. Within the PTSD group, FA values were not correlated with symptom severity 
      or trauma load. Results remained significant after removing participants using 
      psychotropic medication or those with comorbid major depression. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PTSD patients had reduced WM integrity in left hemisphere frontal WM and 
      temporal-occipital WM tracts, compared to trauma-exposed controls. Reduced 
      frontal FA is consistent with compromised top-down attentional control and 
      emotion regulation in PTSD, while reduced ILF FA may be related to sensory 
      processing and gating abnormalities in this disorder.

TI  - Biomarkers, designs, and interpretations of resting-state fMRI in translational 
      pharmacological research: A review of state-of-the-Art, challenges, and 
      opportunities for studying brain chemistry.

AB  - A decade of research and development in resting-state functional MRI (RSfMRI) has 
      opened new translational and clinical research frontiers. This review aims to 
      bridge between technical and clinical researchers who seek reliable neuroimaging 
      biomarkers for studying drug interactions with the brain. About 85 pharma-RSfMRI 
      studies using BOLD signal (75% of all) or arterial spin labeling (ASL) were 
      surveyed to investigate the acute effects of psychoactive drugs. Experimental 
      designs and objectives include drug fingerprinting dose-response evaluation, 
      biomarker validation and calibration, and translational studies. Common 
      biomarkers in these studies include functional connectivity, graph metrics, 
      cerebral blood flow and the amplitude and spectrum of BOLD fluctuations. Overall, 
      RSfMRI-derived biomarkers seem to be sensitive to spatiotemporal dynamics of drug 
      interactions with the brain. However, drugs cause both central and peripheral 
      effects, thus exacerbate difficulties related to biological confounds, structured 
      noise from motion and physiological confounds, as well as modeling and inference 
      testing. Currently, these issues are not well explored, and heterogeneities in 
      experimental design, data acquisition and preprocessing make comparative or 
      meta-analysis of existing reports impossible. A unifying collaborative framework 
      for data-sharing and data-mining is thus necessary for investigating the 
      commonalities and differences in biomarker sensitivity and specificity, and 
      establishing guidelines. Multimodal datasets including sham-placebo or active 
      control sessions and repeated measurements of various psychometric, 
      physiological, metabolic and neuroimaging phenotypes are essential for 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and interpretation of the findings. We 
      provide a list of basic minimum and advanced options that can be considered in 
      design and analyses of future pharma-RSfMRI studies. Hum Brain Mapp 38:2276-2325,

TI  - Comparison of a non-stationary voxelation-corrected cluster-size test with TFCE 
      for group-Level MRI inference.
PG  - 1269-1280
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23453 [doi]
AB  - Two powerful methods for statistical inference on MRI brain images have been 
      proposed recently, a non-stationary voxelation-corrected cluster-size test (CST) 
      based on random field theory and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) based 
      on calculating the level of local support for a cluster, then using permutation 
      testing for inference. Unlike other statistical approaches, these two methods do 
      not rest on the assumptions of a uniform and high degree of spatial smoothness of 
      the statistic image. Thus, they are strongly recommended for group-level fMRI 
      analysis compared to other statistical methods. In this work, the non-stationary 
      voxelation-corrected CST and TFCE methods for group-level analysis were evaluated 
      for both stationary and non-stationary images under varying smoothness levels, 
      degrees of freedom and signal to noise ratios. Our results suggest that, both 
      methods provide adequate control for the number of voxel-wise statistical tests 
      being performed during inference on fMRI data and they are both superior to 
      current CSTs implemented in popular MRI data analysis software packages. However, 
      TFCE is more sensitive and stable for group-level analysis of VBM data. Thus, the 
      voxelation-corrected CST approach may confer some advantages by being 
      computationally less demanding for fMRI data analysis than TFCE with permutation 
      testing and by also being applicable for single-subject fMRI analyses, while the 
      TFCE approach is advantageous for VBM data. Hum Brain Mapp 38:1269-1280, 2017. ©

TI  - Greater sensitivity of the cortical face processing system to 
      perceptually-equated face detection.

AB  - Face detection, the perceptual capacity to identify a visual stimulus as a face 
      before probing deeper into specific attributes (such as its identity or emotion), 
      is essential for social functioning. Despite the importance of this functional 
      capacity, face detection and its underlying brain mechanisms are not well 
      understood. This study evaluated the roles that the cortical face processing 
      system, which is identified largely through studying other aspects of face 
      perception, play in face detection. Specifically, we used functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the activations of the fusifom face area 
      (FFA), occipital face area (OFA) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) when face 
      detection was isolated from other aspects of face perception and when face 
      detection was perceptually-equated across individual human participants (n=20). 
      During face detection, FFA and OFA were significantly activated, even for stimuli 
      presented at perceptual-threshold levels, whereas STS was not. During tree 
      detection, however, FFA and OFA were responsive only for highly salient (i.e., 
      high contrast) stimuli. Moreover, activation of FFA during face detection 
      predicted a significant portion of the perceptual performance levels that were 
      determined psychophysically for each participant. This pattern of result 
      indicates that FFA and OFA have a greater sensitivity to face detection signals 
      and selectively support the initial process of face vs. non-face object 
      perception.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of marijuana (MJ) use among youth and its legalization 
      for medical or recreational use has intensified public health endeavors of 
      understanding MJ effects on brain structure and function. Studies indicate that 
      MJ use is related to impaired cognitive performance, and altered functional brain 
      activation and chemistry in adolescents and adults, but MJ effects on brain 
      morphology in emerging adults are less understood. METHODS: Fifteen MJ users (age 
      21.8±3.6, 2 females) and 15 non-user (NU) participants (age 22.3±3.5, 2 females) 
      were included, demographically matched on age, education and alcohol use. 
      High-resolution structural MR images were acquired at 3Tesla. Cortical thickness 
      (CT) and volumetric analyses were performed using Freesurfer. A priori regions of 
      interest (ROI) included orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices, amygdala, 
      hippocampus and thalamus. RESULTS: Whole brain CT analysis did not result in 
      significant group differences in a priori ROIs but revealed MJ users had 
      significantly less CT (i.e., thinness) in right fusiform gyrus (rFG) compared to 
      NU (p<0.05). Thalamic volume was significantly smaller in MJ users compared to NU 
      (right, p=0.05; left, p=0.01) and associated with greater non-planning (p<0.01) 
      and overall impulsivity (p=0.04). There were no other group differences. 
      CONCLUSIONS: RFG cortical thinness and smaller thalamic volume in emerging adults 
      is associated with MJ abuse. Furthermore, smaller thalamic volume associated with 
      greater impulsivity contributes to growing evidence that the thalamus is 
      neurobiologically perturbed by MJ use. Collectively, altered thalamic and rFG 
      structural integrity may interfere with their known roles in regulating 
      visuoperceptual and object information processing.

AB  - Human brain networks mediating interoceptive, behavioral, and cognitive aspects 
      of glycemic control are not well studied. Using group independent component 
      analysis with dual-regression approach of functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      data, we examined the functional connectivity changes of large-scale resting 
      state networks during sequential euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamp studies in 
      patients with type 1 diabetes and nondiabetic controls and how these changes 
      during hypoglycemia were related to symptoms of hypoglycemia awareness and to 
      concurrent glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. During hypoglycemia, diabetic 
      patients showed increased functional connectivity of the right anterior insula 
      and the prefrontal cortex within the executive control network, which was 
      associated with higher HbA1c. Controls showed decreased functional connectivity 
      of the right anterior insula with the cerebellum/basal ganglia network and of 
      temporal regions within the temporal pole network and increased functional 
      connectivity in the default mode and sensorimotor networks. Functional 
      connectivity reductions in the right basal ganglia were correlated with increases 
      of self-reported hypoglycemic symptoms in controls but not in patients. Resting 
      state networks that showed different group functional connectivity during 
      hypoglycemia may be most sensitive to glycemic environment, and their 
      connectivity patterns may have adapted to repeated glycemic excursions present in 
      type 1 diabetes. Our results suggest that basal ganglia and insula mediation of 
      interoceptive awareness during hypoglycemia is altered in type 1 diabetes. These 
      changes could be neuroplastic adaptations to frequent hypoglycemic experiences. 
      Functional connectivity changes in the insula and prefrontal cognitive networks 
      could also reflect an adaptation to changes in brain metabolic pathways 
      associated with chronic hyperglycemia. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The major factor 
      limiting improved glucose control in type 1 diabetes is the significant increase 
      in hypoglycemia associated with insulin treatment. Repeated exposure to 
      hypoglycemia alters patients' ability to recognize the autonomic and 
      neuroglycopenic symptoms associated with low plasma glucose levels. We examined 
      brain resting state networks during the induction of hypoglycemia in diabetic and 
      control subjects and found differences in networks involved in sensorimotor 
      function, cognition, and interoceptive awareness that were related to chronic 
      levels of glycemic control. These findings identify brain regions that are 
      sensitive to variations in plasma glucose levels and may also provide a basis for 
      understanding the mechanisms underlying the increased incidence of cognitive 
      impairment and affective disorders seen in patients with diabetes.

TI  - Functional Connectivity-Based Parcellation of the Thalamus: An Unsupervised 
      Clustering Method and Its Validity Investigation.
PG  - 620-30
LID - 10.1089/brain.2015.0338 [doi]
AB  - Node definition or delineating how the brain is parcellated into individual 
      functionally related regions is the first step to accurately map the human 
      connectome. As a result, parcellation of the human brain has drawn considerable 
      attention in the field of neuroscience. The thalamus is known as a relay in the 
      human brain, with its nuclei sending fibers to the cortical and subcortical 
      regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer a way to 
      parcellate the thalamus in vivo based on its connectivity properties. However, 
      the parcellations from previous studies show that both the number and the 
      distribution of thalamic subdivisions vary with different cortical segmentation 
      methods. In this study, we used an unsupervised clustering method that does not 
      rely on a priori information of the cortical segmentation to parcellate the 
      thalamus. Instead, this approach is based on the intrinsic resting-state 
      functional connectivity profiles of the thalamus with the whole brain. A series 
      of cluster solutions were obtained, and an optimal solution was determined. 
      Furthermore, the validity of our parcellation was investigated through the 
      following: (1) identifying specific resting-state connectivity patterns of 
      thalamic parcels with different brain networks and (2) investigating the task 
      activation and psychophysiological interactions of specific thalamic clusters 
      during 8-Hz flashing checkerboard stimulation with simultaneous finger tapping. 
      Together, the current study provides a reliable parcellation of the thalamus and 
      enhances our understating of thalamic. Furthermore, the current study provides a 
      framework for parcellation that could be potentially extended to other 
      subcortical and cortical regions.

AB  - Cluster-size tests (CSTs) based on random field theory (RFT) are commonly adopted 
      to identify significant differences in brain images. However, the use of RFT in 
      CSTs rests on the assumption of uniform smoothness (stationarity). When images 
      are non-stationary, CSTs based on RFT will likely lead to increased false 
      positives in smooth regions and reduced power in rough regions. An adjustment to 
      the cluster size according to the local smoothness at each voxel has been 
      proposed for the standard test based on RFT to address non-stationarity, however, 
      this technique requires images with a large degree of spatial smoothing, large 
      degrees of freedom and high intensity thresholding. Recently, we proposed a 
      voxelation-corrected 3D CST based on Gaussian random field theory that does not 
      place constraints on the degree of spatial smoothness. However, this approach is 
      only applicable to stationary images, requiring further modification to enable 
      use for non-stationary images. In this study, we present modifications of this 
      method to develop a voxelation-corrected non-stationary 3D CST based on RFT. Both 
      simulated and real data were used to compare the voxelation-corrected 
      non-stationary CST to the standard cluster-size adjusted non-stationary CST based 
      on RFT and the voxelation-corrected stationary CST. We found that 
      voxelation-corrected stationary CST is liberal for non-stationary images and the 
      voxelation-corrected non-stationary CST performs better than cluster-size 
      adjusted non-stationary CST based on RFT under low smoothness, low intensity 
      threshold and low degrees of freedom.

TI  - Dissociable cortico-striatal connectivity abnormalities in major depression in 
      response to monetary gains and penalties.
PG  - 121-31
LID - 10.1017/S0033291714001123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) are characterized by 
      maladaptive responses to both positive and negative outcomes, which have been 
      linked to localized abnormal activations in cortical and striatal brain regions. 
      However, the exact neural circuitry implicated in such abnormalities remains 
      largely unexplored. METHOD: In this study 26 unmedicated adults with MDD and 29 
      matched healthy controls (HCs) completed a monetary incentive delay task during 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Psychophysiological interaction 
      (PPI) analyses probed group differences in connectivity separately in response to 
      positive and negative outcomes (i.e. monetary gains and penalties). RESULTS: 
      Relative to HCs, MDD subjects displayed decreased connectivity between the 
      caudate and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in response to monetary 
      gains, yet increased connectivity between the caudate and a different, more 
      rostral, dACC subregion in response to monetary penalties. Moreover, exploratory 
      analyses of 14 MDD patients who completed a 12-week, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial after the baseline fMRI scans indicated that a 
      more normative pattern of cortico-striatal connectivity pre-treatment was 
      associated with greater improvement in symptoms 12 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results identify the caudate as a region with dissociable 
      incentive-dependent dACC connectivity abnormalities in MDD, and provide initial 
      evidence that cortico-striatal circuitry may play a role in MDD treatment 
      response. Given the role of cortico-striatal circuitry in encoding action-outcome 
      contingencies, such dysregulated connectivity may relate to the prominent 
      disruptions in goal-directed behavior that characterize MDD.

AB  - Cluster-size tests (CST) based on random field theory have been widely adopted in 
      fMRI data analysis to detect brain activation. However, most existing approaches 
      can be used appropriately only when the image is highly smoothed in the spatial 
      domain. Unfortunately, spatial smoothing degrades spatial specificity. Recently, 
      a threshold-free cluster enhancement technique was proposed which does not 
      require spatial smoothing, but this method can be used only for group level 
      analysis. Advances in imaging technology now yield high quality high spatial 
      resolution imaging data in single subjects and an inference approach that retains 
      the benefits of greater spatial resolution is called for. In this work, we 
      present a new CST with a correction for voxelation to address this problem. The 
      theoretical formulation of the new approach based on Gaussian random fields is 
      developed to estimate statistical significance using 3D statistical parametric 
      maps without assuming spatial smoothness. Simulated phantom and resting-state 
      fMRI experimental data are then used to compare the voxelation-corrected 
      procedure to the widely used standard random field theory. Unlike standard random 
      field theory approaches, which require heavy spatial smoothing, the new approach 
      has a higher sensitivity for localizing activation regions without the 
      requirement of spatial smoothness.

      reward processing.

AB  - Anhedonia is one of the core symptoms of depression and has been linked to 
      blunted responses to rewarding stimuli in striatal regions. Stress, a key 
      vulnerability factor for depression, has been shown to induce anhedonic behavior, 
      including reduced reward responsiveness in both animals and humans, but the brain 
      processes associated with these effects remain largely unknown in humans. 
      Emerging evidence suggests that stress has dissociable effects on distinct 
      components of reward processing, as it has been found to potentiate 
      motivation/'wanting' during the anticipatory phase but reduce reward 
      responsiveness/'liking' during the consummatory phase. To examine the impact of 
      stress on reward processing, we used a monetary incentive delay (MID) task and an 
      acute stress manipulation (negative performance feedback) in conjunction with 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy participants 
      performed the MID task under no-stress and stress conditions. We hypothesized 
      that stress would have dissociable effects on the anticipatory and consummatory 
      phases in reward-related brain regions. Specifically, we expected reduced 
      striatal responsiveness during reward consumption (mirroring patterns previously 
      observed in clinical depression) and increased striatal activation during reward 
      anticipation consistent with non-human findings. Supporting our hypotheses, 
      significant Phase (Anticipation/Consumption)×Stress (Stress/No-stress) 
      interactions emerged in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, caudate and amygdala. 
      Post hoc tests revealed that stress increased striatal and amygdalar activation 
      during anticipation but decreased striatal activation during consumption. 
      Importantly, stress-induced striatal blunting was similar to the profile observed 
      in clinical depression under baseline (no-stress) conditions in prior studies. 
      Given that stress is a pivotal vulnerability factor for depression, these results 
      offer insight to better understand the etiology of this prevalent disorder.

AB  - Craving is a key aspect of drug dependence that is thought to motivate continued 
      drug use. Numerous brain regions have been associated with craving, suggesting 
      that craving is mediated by a distributed brain network. Whether an increase in 
      subjective craving is associated with enhanced interactions among brain regions 
      was evaluated using resting state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in nicotine 
      dependent participants. We focused on craving-related changes in the orbital and 
      medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) network, which also included the subgenual 
      anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) extending into the ventral striatum. Brain 
      regions in the OMPFC network are not only implicated in addiction and reward, 
      but, due to their rich anatomic interconnections, may serve as the site of 
      integration across craving-related brain regions. Subjective craving and resting 
      state fMRI were evaluated twice with an ∼1 hour delay between the scans. 
      Cigarette craving was significantly increased at the end, relative to the 
      beginning of the scan session. Enhanced craving was associated with heightened 
      coupling between the OMPFC network and other cortical, limbic, striatal, and 
      visceromotor brain regions that are both anatomically interconnected with the 
      OMPFC, and have been implicated in addiction and craving. This is the first 
      demonstration confirming that an increase in craving is associated with enhanced 
      brain region interactions, which may play a role in the experience of craving.

AB  - Nicotine dependence is a chronic and difficult to treat disorder. While 
      environmental stimuli associated with smoking precipitate craving and relapse, it 
      is unknown whether smoking cues are cognitively processed differently than 
      neutral stimuli. To evaluate working memory differences between smoking-related 
      and neutral stimuli, we conducted a delay-match-to-sample (DMS) task concurrently 
      with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in nicotine-dependent 
      participants. The DMS task evaluates brain activation during the encoding, 
      maintenance and retrieval phases of working memory. Smoking images induced 
      significantly more subjective craving, and greater midline cortical activation 
      during encoding in comparison to neutral stimuli that were similar in content yet 
      lacked a smoking component. The insula, which is involved in maintaining nicotine 
      dependence, was active during the successful retrieval of previously viewed 
      smoking versus neutral images. In contrast, neutral images required more 
      prefrontal cortex-mediated active maintenance during the maintenance period. 
      These findings indicate that distinct brain regions are involved in the different 
      phases of working memory for smoking-related versus neutral images. Importantly, 
      the results implicate the insula in the retrieval of smoking-related stimuli, 
      which is relevant given the insula's emerging role in addiction.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of systemic low frequency oscillations measured in the 
      periphery on the independent component analysis results of resting state 
      networks.

AB  - Independent component analysis (ICA) is widely used in resting state functional 
      connectivity studies. ICA is a data-driven method, which uses no a priori 
      anatomical or functional assumptions. However, as a result, it still relies on 
      the user to distinguish the independent components (ICs) corresponding to 
      neuronal activation, peripherally originating signals (without directly 
      attributable neuronal origin, such as respiration, cardiac pulsation and Mayer 
      wave), and acquisition artifacts. In this concurrent near infrared spectroscopy 
      (NIRS)/functional MRI (fMRI) resting state study, we developed a method to 
      systematically and quantitatively identify the ICs that show strong contributions 
      from signals originating in the periphery. We applied group ICA (MELODIC from 
      FSL) to the resting state data of 10 healthy participants. The systemic low 
      frequency oscillation (LFO) detected simultaneously at each participant's 
      fingertip by NIRS was used as a regressor to correlate with every 
      subject-specific IC time course. The ICs that had high correlation with the 
      systemic LFO were those closely associated with previously described 
      sensorimotor, visual, and auditory networks. The ICs associated with the default 
      mode and frontoparietal networks were less affected by the peripheral signals. 
      The consistency and reproducibility of the results were evaluated using 
      bootstrapping. This result demonstrates that systemic, low frequency oscillations 
      in hemodynamic properties overlay the time courses of many spatial patterns 
      identified in ICA analyses, which complicates the detection and interpretation of 
      connectivity in these regions of the brain.

AB  - Networks of brain regions having synchronized fluctuations of the blood oxygen 
      level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) time-series at 
      rest, or "resting state networks" (RSNs), are emerging as a basis for 
      understanding intrinsic brain activity. RSNs are topographically consistent with 
      activity-related networks subserving sensory, motor, and cognitive processes, and 
      studying their spontaneous fluctuations following acute drug challenge may 
      provide a way to understand better the neuroanatomical substrates of drug action. 
      The present within-subject double-blind study used BOLD fMRI at 3T to investigate 
      the functional networks influenced by the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem 
      (Ambien). Zolpidem is a positive modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) 
      receptors, and engenders sedative effects that may be explained in part by how it 
      modulates intrinsic brain activity. Healthy participants (n=12) underwent fMRI 
      scanning 45 min after acute oral administration of zolpidem (0, 5, 10, or 20mg), 
      and changes in BOLD signal were measured while participants gazed at a static 
      fixation point (i.e., at rest). Data were analyzed using group independent 
      component analysis (ICA) with dual regression and results indicated that compared 
      to placebo, the highest dose of zolpidem increased functional connectivity within 
      a number of sensory, motor, and limbic networks. These results are consistent 
      with previous studies showing an increase in functional connectivity at rest 
      following administration of the positive GABA(A) receptor modulators midazolam 
      and alcohol, and suggest that investigating how zolpidem modulates intrinsic 
      brain activity may have implications for understanding the etiology of its 
      powerful sedative effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain dysfunction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal striatum (DS) 
      contributes to habitual drug use. These regions are constituents of brain 
      networks thought to be involved in drug addiction. To investigate whether 
      networks containing these regions differ between nicotine dependent female 
      smokers and age-matched female non-smokers, we employed functional MRI (fMRI) at 
      rest. METHODS: Data were processed with independent component analysis (ICA) to 
      identify resting state networks (RSNs). We identified a subcortical limbic 
      network and three discrete PFC networks: a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 
      network and right and left lateralized fronto-parietal networks common to all 
      subjects. We then compared these RSNs between smokers and non-smokers using a 
      dual regression approach. RESULTS: Smokers had greater coupling versus 
      non-smokers between left fronto-parietal and mPFC networks. Smokers with the 
      greatest mPFC-left fronto-parietal coupling had the most DS smoking cue 
      reactivity as measured during an fMRI smoking cue reactivity paradigm. This may 
      be important because the DS plays a critical role in maintaining drug-cue 
      associations. Furthermore, subcortical limbic network amplitude was greater in 
      smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prefrontal brain networks are more 
      strongly coupled in smokers, which could facilitate drug-cue responding. Our data 
      also are the first to document greater reward-related network fMRI amplitude in 
      smokers. Our findings suggest that resting state PFC network interactions and 
      limbic network amplitude can differentiate nicotine-dependent smokers from 
      controls, and may serve as biomarkers for nicotine dependence severity and 
      treatment efficacy.

TI  - Physiological denoising of BOLD fMRI data using Regressor Interpolation at 
      Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) processing of concurrent fMRI and near-infrared 
      spectroscopy (NIRS).
PG  - 1913-23
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.140 [doi]
AB  - Confounding noise in BOLD fMRI data arises primarily from fluctuations in blood 
      flow and oxygenation due to cardiac and respiratory effects, spontaneous low 
      frequency oscillations (LFO) in arterial pressure, and non-task related neural 
      activity. Cardiac noise is particularly problematic, as the low sampling 
      frequency of BOLD fMRI ensures that these effects are aliased in recorded data. 
      Various methods have been proposed to estimate the noise signal through 
      measurement and transformation of the cardiac and respiratory waveforms (e.g. 
      RETROICOR and respiration volume per time (RVT)) and model-free estimation of 
      noise variance through examination of spatial and temporal patterns. We have 
      previously demonstrated that by applying a voxel-specific time delay to 
      concurrently acquired near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data, we can generate 
      regressors that reflect systemic blood flow and oxygenation fluctuations effects. 
      Here, we apply this method to the task of removing physiological noise from BOLD 
      data. We compare the efficacy of noise removal using various sets of noise 
      regressors generated from NIRS data, and also compare the noise removal to 
      RETROICOR+RVT. We compare the results of resting state analyses using the 
      original and noise filtered data, and we evaluate the bias for the different 
      noise filtration methods by computing null distributions from the resting data 
      and comparing them with the expected theoretical distributions. Using the best 
      set of processing choices, six NIRS-generated regressors with voxel-specific time 
      delays explain a median of 10.5% of the variance throughout the brain, with the 
      highest reductions being seen in gray matter. By comparison, the nine 
      RETROICOR+RVT regressors together explain a median of 6.8% of the variance in the 
      BOLD data. Detection of resting state networks was enhanced with NIRS denoising, 
      and there were no appreciable differences in the bias of the different 
      techniques. Physiological noise regressors generated using Regressor 
      Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offer an effective method for 
      efficiently removing hemodynamic noise from BOLD data.

LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.11.063 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have demonstrated age-related regional differences in the 
      magnitude of the BOLD signal using task-based fMRI. It has been suggested that 
      functional changes reflect either compensatory or de-differentiation mechanisms, 
      both of which assume response to a specific stimulus. Here, we have tested 
      whether ageing affects both task-based and resting brain function, and the extent 
      to which functional changes are mediated by reductions in grey matter (GM) 
      volume. Two groups, of 22 healthy younger and 22 older volunteers, underwent an 
      imaging protocol involving structural and functional MRI, both during a memory 
      task and at rest. The two groups had similar socio-demographical characteristics 
      and cognitive performance. Image analysis revealed both structural and functional 
      differences. Increased BOLD signal in older relative to younger volunteers was 
      mainly observed in the frontal lobes, both during the task and at rest. 
      Functional changes in the frontal lobes were largely located in brain regions 
      spared from GM loss, and adding GM covariates to the fMRI analysis did not 
      significantly alter the group differences. Our results are consistent with the 
      suggestion that, during normal ageing, the brain responds to neuronal loss by 
      fine-tuning connections between spared neurons. Longitudinal studies will be 
      necessary to fully test this hypothesis.

AB  - The authors measured event-related potentials with a craving manipulation to 
      investigate the neural correlates of drug cue reactivity in 13 adolescents who 
      are cannabis dependent (CD; ages 14-17). The P300 responses to marijuana (MJ) 
      pictures (MJ-P300) and control pictures (C-P300) were assessed after handling 
      neutral objects and again after handling MJ paraphernalia (MJP). Self-reported 
      drug craving and heart rates also were measured. MJ-P300 were larger than C-P300 
      (p < .001), and both the MJ-P300 and craving increased significantly after 
      handling MJP (p = .002 and p = .003, respectively), with no association between 
      the magnitude of craving and MJ-P300. Heart rates were not affected by handling 
      MJP. The results showed that adolescents who are CD have an attentional bias to 
      MJ stimuli that increases after handling marijuana paraphernalia. Generally, the 
      results are consistent with what has been reported for adult heavy chronic 
      cannabis smokers, although there were some differences that require further 
      investigation.

AB  - Many blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging studies have shown a strong response due to cocaine in brain regions with 
      high concentrations of dopamine receptors. However, cocaine also has non-specific 
      effects, including cardiovascular changes that may cause changes in BOLD signals, 
      raising the possibility that measured changes could be due to these non-specific 
      effects. The following experiment was conducted to address this concern. Subjects 
      were given either cocaine or saline infusions during a long BOLD functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging study. A flashing uniform-field stimulus, periodically 
      alternating between on and off, provided a strong activation of primary visual 
      cortex. There was a significant main effect of drug between cocaine and placebo. 
      Although we did not demonstrate a significant drug x time interaction, BOLD 
      signal changes associated with visual stimulation appeared unchanged after 
      cocaine administration, whereas the signal differences appeared to decrease 
      during placebo. Explanation of the differential response between the two groups 
      may reflect cocaine expectancy instead of a direct effect of cocaine on BOLD 
      signal changes but will require further investigation to fully elucidate.

TI  - An MR-compatible device for delivering smoked marijuana during functional 
      imaging.
PG  - 81-9
AB  - Smoking is the preferred method of administration for two of the most frequently 
      abused drugs, marijuana and nicotine. The high temporal and spatial resolution of 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) make it a natural choice for 
      studying the neurobiological effects of smoked drugs if the challenges of smoking 
      in a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner can be overcome. We report on a design for 
      an MR-compatible smoking device that can be used for smoking marijuana (or 
      tobacco) during fMRI examinations. Nine volunteers smoked marijuana cigarettes 
      (3.51% Delta9-THC) on two occasions: with and without the device. The device 
      allowed subjects to smoke while they lay in the scanner, while containing all 
      smoke and odors. Plasma Delta9-THC, subjective reports of intoxication, and heart 
      rate increases are reported, and were all similar in individuals smoking 
      marijuana either with or without the device. The use of this device will help 
      advance research studies on smoked drugs including marijuana, tobacco and crack 
      cocaine.

TI  - Estimation of the local statistical noise in positron emission tomography 
      revisited: practical implementation.
PG  - 442-56
AB  - The purpose of this report is to implement novel modifications to overcome the 
      limitations of an existing algorithm for estimating the local statistical noise 
      in a positron emission tomography (PET) image without performing repeated 
      measures. The original algorithm is based on a modification of the filtered 
      back-projection algorithm that allows the variance to be estimated using only a 
      single sinogram. In addition, the effects of photon absorption, random 
      coincidences, radioactive decay, and detector nonuniformity are taken into 
      account. However, there are some limitations when applying this method with 
      modern scanners. In particular, it is common practice to interleave the 
      projections in the sinogram (to increase the sampling rate along each projection) 
      and to perform an interpolation when actually back-projecting to reconstruct the 
      images. Both of these procedures introduce covariance among the elements of the 
      projections, which is cumbersome and impractical to deal with using the existing 
      technique for creating a variance image. An alternative image reconstruction 
      scheme that is shown to be equivalent to image reconstruction using traditional 
      filtered back-projection greatly simplifies the estimation of the variance image. 
      The proposed methods were tested by Monte Carlo simulations and by using repeated 
      scans of a uniform phantom filled with F-18. Results demonstrate that the 
      proposed methods are very rigorous and stable when compared to calculations of 
      the local variance using either repeated measures with a large number of 
      measurements, or region-of-interest estimates of the variance, assuming 
      homogeneous variance structure. In addition, strategies for extending the 
      proposed technique are discussed that would permit the estimation of the variance 
      due to measurement error of a pixel in a brain map from both single subjects and 
      pooled group data.

TI  - Changes in regional cerebral metabolism during systemic hyperthermia in humans.
PG  - 846-51
AB  - Whole body hyperthermia may produce vasodialation, nausea, and altered cognitive 
      function. Animal research has identified brain regions that have important roles 
      in thermoregulation. However, differences in both the cognitive and sweating 
      abilities of humans and animals implicate the need for human research. Positron 
      emission tomography (PET) was used to identify brain regions with altered 
      activity during systemic hyperthermia. Human subjects were studied under cool 
      (control) conditions and during steady-state hyperthermia induced by means of a 
      liquid-conditioned suit perfused with hot water. PET images were obtained by 
      injecting [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose, waiting 20 min for brain uptake, and then 
      scanning for 10 min. Heating was associated with a 23% increase in resting 
      metabolic rate. Significant increases in cerebral metabolic rate occurred in the 
      hypothalamus, thalamus, corpus callosum, cingulate gyrus, and cerebellum. In 
      contrast, significant decreases occurred in the caudate, putamen, insula, and 
      posterior cingulum. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms 
      responsible for altered cognitive and systemic responses during hyperthermia. 
      Novel regions (e.g., lateral cerebellum) with possible thermoregulatory roles 
      were identified.

TI  - A tool for comparison of PET and fMRI methods: calculation of the uncertainty in 
      the location of an activation site in a PET image.
PG  - 194-201
AB  - A technique for calculating the uncertainty in the location of an activation site 
      in a PET image, without performing repeated measures, is presented. With the 
      development of new fMRI methods for measuring cerebral hemodynamics, 
      demonstration of the efficacy of these techniques will be critical to establish 
      clinical utility. Comparisons with PET are a powerful tool for validating these 
      new fMRI techniques. In addition to the fact that PET techniques are 
      well-established methods for making physiological measurements in vivo, PET 
      methods are also free of the geometric distortions and nonuniform signal-to-noise 
      artifacts (due to signal dropout) common in fMRI techniques. Comparisons reported 
      previously have been limited by the large number of trials acquired in 
      single-subject fMRI studies and the small number of trials in a PET study (due to 
      the radiation dose to the patient or the interscan delays for tracer decay). Our 
      method calculates both the center of mass (CM) of a predefined region of interest 
      and the uncertainty in the location of the CM using the preimage PET data 
      (sinograms). Results of phantom studies demonstrate that our method is an 
      unbiased measurement equivalent to that of repeated measures with a large number 
      of images. Extension of this technique to estimate the uncertainty in the 
      location of an activation site in a PET statistical parametric map will permit 
      precise rigorous comparisons of PET and fMRI methods in single subjects without 
      the constraints imposed by the relatively small number of PET measurements.

TI  - Comparison of the temporal response in perfusion and BOLD-based event-related 
      functional MRI.
PG  - 768-72
AB  - Event-related functional MRI (ER-fMRI) based on both blood oxygen level-dependent 
      (BOLD) contrast and perfusion contrast has been recently developed to study human 
      brain activation due to brief stimulation. In this report, both BOLD- and 
      perfusion-based ER-fMRI were directly compared using repeated single-trial, short 
      visual stimulation (1 sec) in six human volunteers. The results show that the 
      cerebral blood flow change reached a maximum approximately 1 sec earlier than the 
      BOLD signal change (4.2 +/- 0.2 sec vs. 5.1 +/- 0.2 sec after the stimulation, P 
      < 0.05). The full width at half maximum of the hemodynamic response measured by 
      perfusion was not significantly different from that measured with BOLD (5.1 +/- 
      0.6 sec vs. 5.9 +/- 0.6 sec). A positive linear correlation was found between the 
      maximum perfusion and maximum BOLD signal changes (r = 0. 77, P = 0.07).

TI  - Effect of partition coefficient, permeability surface product, and radioisotope 
      on the signal-to-noise ratio in PET functional brain mapping: a computer 
      simulation.
PG  - 151-60
AB  - In this work we use a computer simulation to estimate the magnitude of 
      improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of PET functional brain mapping studies 
      as a function of partition coefficient and permeability surface product for O-14, 
      F-17, and O-15 labeled flow tracers. A model for signal-to-noise ratio is derived 
      from the Kety model for inert diffusible blood flow tracers. The results of the 
      simulation suggest that moderate increases in partition coefficient and 
      permeability surface product compared with water would lead to an increase in 
      signal-to-noise ratio of a factor of about 3.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of hyperpolarized xenon: implications for cerebral MRI.
PG  - 848-54
AB  - In this work, a compartmental model to predict the concentration of 
      hyperpolarized xenon (Xe) in the brain is developed based on the well established 
      kinetics of Xe and estimated T1 values for the compartments. For the gaseous 
      compartments, T1 was set to 12 seconds. For the tissue compartments, T1 was set 
      to 6 seconds. Three gas delivery techniques were modeled: hyperventilation 
      followed by breath-hold, continual breathing, and hyperventilation followed by 
      continual breathing. Based on Xe CT, it is estimated that the maximum 
      concentration of Xe that could be breathed is 80%. Based on this value and the 
      estimated maximum polarization of 50%, the peak gray matter concentration of 
      hyperpolarized Xe is calculated to be .036 mM. This leads to an estimated 
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), at 2 T, for hyperpolarized Xe that is a factor of 50 
      lower than the SNR for proton MRI. The peak concentration of hyperpolarized Xe 
      was also calculated over a wide range of gas and tissue T1 values. This model 
      also predicts that the arterial blood will have a concentration of hyperpolarized 
      Xe that is 10 times greater than the concentration in gray matter. An interactive 
      version of the model can be found on the World Wide Web at 
      http:(/)/ric.uthscsa.edu/staff /charlesmartinphd.html.
