	abstract = {In this work, a compartmental model to predict the concentration of hyperpolarized xenon (Xe) in the brain is developed based on the well established  kinetics of Xe and estimated T1 values for the compartments. For the gaseous  compartments, T1 was set to 12 seconds. For the tissue compartments, T1 was set  to 6 seconds. Three gas delivery techniques were modeled: hyperventilation  followed by breath-hold, continual breathing, and hyperventilation followed by  continual breathing. Based on Xe CT, it is estimated that the maximum  concentration of Xe that could be breathed is 80\%. Based on this value and the  estimated maximum polarization of 50\%, the peak gray matter concentration of  hyperpolarized Xe is calculated to be .036 mM. This leads to an estimated  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), at 2 T, for hyperpolarized Xe that is a factor of 50  lower than the SNR for proton MRI. The peak concentration of hyperpolarized Xe  was also calculated over a wide range of gas and tissue T1 values. This model  also predicts that the arterial blood will have a concentration of hyperpolarized  Xe that is 10 times greater than the concentration in gray matter.

With the  development of new fMRI methods for measuring cerebral hemodynamics,  demonstration of the efficacy of these techniques will be critical to establish  clinical utility. Comparisons with PET are a powerful tool for validating these  new fMRI techniques. In addition to the fact that PET techniques are  well-established methods for making physiological measurements in vivo, PET  methods are also free of the geometric distortions and nonuniform signal-to-noise  artifacts (due to signal dropout) common in fMRI techniques. Comparisons reported  previously have been limited by the large number of trials acquired in  single-subject fMRI studies and the small number of trials in a PET study (due to  the radiation dose to the patient or the interscan delays for tracer decay). Our  method calculates both the center of mass (CM) of a predefined region of interest  and the uncertainty in the location of the CM using the preimage PET data  (sinograms). Results of phantom studies demonstrate that our method is an  unbiased measurement equivalent to that of repeated measures with a large number  of images. Extension of this technique to estimate the uncertainty in the  location of an activation site in a PET statistical parametric map will permit  precise rigorous comparisons of PET and fMRI methods in single subjects without  the constraints imposed by the relatively small number of PET measurements.},

Significant increases in cerebral metabolic rate occurred in the  hypothalamus, thalamus, corpus callosum, cingulate gyrus, and cerebellum. In  contrast, significant decreases occurred in the caudate, putamen, insula, and  posterior cingulum. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms  responsible for altered cognitive and systemic responses during hyperthermia.

The following experiment was conducted to address this concern. Subjects  were given either cocaine or saline infusions during a long BOLD functional  magnetic resonance imaging study. A flashing uniform-field stimulus, periodically  alternating between on and off, provided a strong activation of primary visual  cortex. There was a significant main effect of drug between cocaine and placebo.  Although we did not demonstrate a significant drug x time interaction, BOLD  signal changes associated with visual stimulation appeared unchanged after  cocaine administration, whereas the signal differences appeared to decrease  during placebo.

	abstract = {The purpose of this report is to implement novel modifications to overcome the limitations of an existing algorithm for estimating the local statistical noise  in a positron emission tomography (PET) image without performing repeated  measures. The original algorithm is based on a modification of the filtered  back-projection algorithm that allows the variance to be estimated using only a  single sinogram. In addition, the effects of photon absorption, random  coincidences, radioactive decay, and detector nonuniformity are taken into  account. However, there are some limitations when applying this method with  modern scanners. In particular, it is common practice to interleave the  projections in the sinogram (to increase the sampling rate along each projection)  and to perform an interpolation when actually back-projecting to reconstruct the  images. Both of these procedures introduce covariance among the elements of the  projections, which is cumbersome and impractical to deal with using the existing  technique for creating a variance image. An alternative image reconstruction  scheme that is shown to be equivalent to image reconstruction using traditional  filtered back-projection greatly simplifies the estimation of the variance image.  The proposed methods were tested by Monte Carlo simulations and by using repeated  scans of a uniform phantom filled with F-18. Results demonstrate that the  proposed methods are very rigorous and stable when compared to calculations of  the local variance using either repeated measures with a large number of  measurements, or region-of-interest estimates of the variance, assuming  homogeneous variance structure. In addition, strategies for extending the  proposed technique are discussed that would permit the estimation of the variance  due to measurement error of a pixel in a brain map from both single subjects and  pooled group data.},

Two groups, of 22 healthy younger and 22 older volunteers, underwent an  imaging protocol involving structural and functional MRI, both during a memory  task and at rest. The two groups had similar socio-demographical characteristics  and cognitive performance. Image analysis revealed both structural and functional  differences. Increased BOLD signal in older relative to younger volunteers was  mainly observed in the frontal lobes, both during the task and at rest.  Functional changes in the frontal lobes were largely located in brain regions  spared from GM loss, and adding GM covariates to the fMRI analysis did not  significantly alter the group differences. Our results are consistent with the  suggestion that, during normal ageing, the brain responds to neuronal loss by  fine-tuning connections between spared neurons. Longitudinal studies will be  necessary to fully test this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Confounding noise in BOLD fMRI data arises primarily from fluctuations in blood flow and oxygenation due to cardiac and respiratory effects, spontaneous low  frequency oscillations (LFO) in arterial pressure, and non-task related neural  activity. Cardiac noise is particularly problematic, as the low sampling  frequency of BOLD fMRI ensures that these effects are aliased in recorded data.  Various methods have been proposed to estimate the noise signal through  measurement and transformation of the cardiac and respiratory waveforms (e.g.  RETROICOR and respiration volume per time (RVT)) and model-free estimation of  noise variance through examination of spatial and temporal patterns. We have  previously demonstrated that by applying a voxel-specific time delay to  concurrently acquired near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data, we can generate  regressors that reflect systemic blood flow and oxygenation fluctuations effects.  Here, we apply this method to the task of removing physiological noise from BOLD  data. We compare the efficacy of noise removal using various sets of noise  regressors generated from NIRS data, and also compare the noise removal to  RETROICOR+RVT. We compare the results of resting state analyses using the  original and noise filtered data, and we evaluate the bias for the different  noise filtration methods by computing null distributions from the resting data  and comparing them with the expected theoretical distributions. Using the best  set of processing choices, six NIRS-generated regressors with voxel-specific time  delays explain a median of 10.5\% of the variance throughout the brain, with the  highest reductions being seen in gray matter. By comparison, the nine  RETROICOR+RVT regressors together explain a median of 6.8\% of the variance in the  BOLD data. Detection of resting state networks was enhanced with NIRS denoising,  and there were no appreciable differences in the bias of the different  techniques. Physiological noise regressors generated using Regressor  Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offer an effective method for  efficiently removing hemodynamic noise from BOLD data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brain dysfunction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal striatum (DS) contributes to habitual drug use. These regions are constituents of brain  networks thought to be involved in drug addiction. To investigate whether  networks containing these regions differ between nicotine dependent female  smokers and age-matched female non-smokers, we employed functional MRI (fMRI) at  rest. METHODS: Data were processed with independent component analysis (ICA) to  identify resting state networks (RSNs). We identified a subcortical limbic  network and three discrete PFC networks: a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)  network and right and left lateralized fronto-parietal networks common to all  subjects. We then compared these RSNs between smokers and non-smokers using a  dual regression approach. RESULTS: Smokers had greater coupling versus  non-smokers between left fronto-parietal and mPFC networks. Smokers with the  greatest mPFC-left fronto-parietal coupling had the most DS smoking cue  reactivity as measured during an fMRI smoking cue reactivity paradigm. This may  be important because the DS plays a critical role in maintaining drug-cue  associations. Furthermore, subcortical limbic network amplitude was greater in  smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prefrontal brain networks are more  strongly coupled in smokers, which could facilitate drug-cue responding. Our data  also are the first to document greater reward-related network fMRI amplitude in  smokers. Our findings suggest that resting state PFC network interactions and  limbic network amplitude can differentiate nicotine-dependent smokers from  controls, and may serve as biomarkers for nicotine dependence severity and  treatment efficacy.},

ICA is a data-driven method, which uses no a priori  anatomical or functional assumptions. However, as a result, it still relies on  the user to distinguish the independent components (ICs) corresponding to  neuronal activation, peripherally originating signals (without directly  attributable neuronal origin, such as respiration, cardiac pulsation and Mayer  wave), and acquisition artifacts. In this concurrent near infrared spectroscopy  (NIRS)/functional MRI (fMRI) resting state study, we developed a method to  systematically and quantitatively identify the ICs that show strong contributions  from signals originating in the periphery. We applied group ICA (MELODIC from  FSL) to the resting state data of 10 healthy participants. The systemic low  frequency oscillation (LFO) detected simultaneously at each participant's  fingertip by NIRS was used as a regressor to correlate with every  subject-specific IC time course. The ICs that had high correlation with the  systemic LFO were those closely associated with previously described  sensorimotor, visual, and auditory networks. The ICs associated with the default  mode and frontoparietal networks were less affected by the peripheral signals.  The consistency and reproducibility of the results were evaluated using  bootstrapping. This result demonstrates that systemic, low frequency oscillations  in hemodynamic properties overlay the time courses of many spatial patterns  identified in ICA analyses, which complicates the detection and interpretation of  connectivity in these regions of the brain.},

While environmental stimuli associated with smoking precipitate craving and relapse, it  is unknown whether smoking cues are cognitively processed differently than  neutral stimuli. To evaluate working memory differences between smoking-related  and neutral stimuli, we conducted a delay-match-to-sample (DMS) task concurrently  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in nicotine-dependent  participants. The DMS task evaluates brain activation during the encoding,  maintenance and retrieval phases of working memory. Smoking images induced  significantly more subjective craving, and greater midline cortical activation  during encoding in comparison to neutral stimuli that were similar in content yet  lacked a smoking component. The insula, which is involved in maintaining nicotine  dependence, was active during the successful retrieval of previously viewed  smoking versus neutral images. In contrast, neutral images required more  prefrontal cortex-mediated active maintenance during the maintenance period.  These findings indicate that distinct brain regions are involved in the different  phases of working memory for smoking-related versus neutral images. Importantly,  the results implicate the insula in the retrieval of smoking-related stimuli,  which is relevant given the insula's emerging role in addiction.},

	abstract = {Cluster-size tests (CSTs) based on random field theory (RFT) are commonly adopted to identify significant differences in brain images. However, the use of RFT in  CSTs rests on the assumption of uniform smoothness (stationarity). When images  are non-stationary, CSTs based on RFT will likely lead to increased false  positives in smooth regions and reduced power in rough regions. An adjustment to  the cluster size according to the local smoothness at each voxel has been  proposed for the standard test based on RFT to address non-stationarity, however,  this technique requires images with a large degree of spatial smoothing, large  degrees of freedom and high intensity thresholding. Recently, we proposed a  voxelation-corrected 3D CST based on Gaussian random field theory that does not  place constraints on the degree of spatial smoothness. However, this approach is  only applicable to stationary images, requiring further modification to enable  use for non-stationary images. In this study, we present modifications of this  method to develop a voxelation-corrected non-stationary 3D CST based on RFT. Both  simulated and real data were used to compare the voxelation-corrected  non-stationary CST to the standard cluster-size adjusted non-stationary CST based  on RFT and the voxelation-corrected stationary CST. We found that  voxelation-corrected stationary CST is liberal for non-stationary images and the  voxelation-corrected non-stationary CST performs better than cluster-size  adjusted non-stationary CST based on RFT under low smoothness, low intensity  threshold and low degrees of freedom.},

RSNs are topographically consistent with  activity-related networks subserving sensory, motor, and cognitive processes, and  studying their spontaneous fluctuations following acute drug challenge may  provide a way to understand better the neuroanatomical substrates of drug action.  The present within-subject double-blind study used BOLD fMRI at 3T to investigate  the functional networks influenced by the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem  (Ambien). Zolpidem is a positive modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A))  receptors, and engenders sedative effects that may be explained in part by how it  modulates intrinsic brain activity. Healthy participants (n=12) underwent fMRI  scanning 45 min after acute oral administration of zolpidem (0, 5, 10, or 20mg),  and changes in BOLD signal were measured while participants gazed at a static  fixation point (i.e., at rest). Data were analyzed using group independent  component analysis (ICA) with dual regression and results indicated that compared  to placebo, the highest dose of zolpidem increased functional connectivity within  a number of sensory, motor, and limbic networks. These results are consistent  with previous studies showing an increase in functional connectivity at rest  following administration of the positive GABA(A) receptor modulators midazolam  and alcohol, and suggest that investigating how zolpidem modulates intrinsic  brain activity may have implications for understanding the etiology of its  powerful sedative effects.},

Numerous brain regions have been associated with craving, suggesting  that craving is mediated by a distributed brain network. Whether an increase in  subjective craving is associated with enhanced interactions among brain regions  was evaluated using resting state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in nicotine  dependent participants. We focused on craving-related changes in the orbital and  medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) network, which also included the subgenual  anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) extending into the ventral striatum. Brain  regions in the OMPFC network are not only implicated in addiction and reward,  but, due to their rich anatomic interconnections, may serve as the site of  integration across craving-related brain regions. Subjective craving and resting  state fMRI were evaluated twice with an ∼1 hour delay between the scans.  Cigarette craving was significantly increased at the end, relative to the  beginning of the scan session. Enhanced craving was associated with heightened  coupling between the OMPFC network and other cortical, limbic, striatal, and  visceromotor brain regions that are both anatomically interconnected with the  OMPFC, and have been implicated in addiction and craving. This is the first  demonstration confirming that an increase in craving is associated with enhanced  brain region interactions, which may play a role in the experience of craving.},

	abstract = {Anhedonia is one of the core symptoms of depression and has been linked to blunted responses to rewarding stimuli in striatal regions. Stress, a key  vulnerability factor for depression, has been shown to induce anhedonic behavior,  including reduced reward responsiveness in both animals and humans, but the brain  processes associated with these effects remain largely unknown in humans.  Emerging evidence suggests that stress has dissociable effects on distinct  components of reward processing, as it has been found to potentiate  motivation/'wanting' during the anticipatory phase but reduce reward  responsiveness/'liking' during the consummatory phase. To examine the impact of  stress on reward processing, we used a monetary incentive delay (MID) task and an  acute stress manipulation (negative performance feedback) in conjunction with  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy participants  performed the MID task under no-stress and stress conditions. We hypothesized  that stress would have dissociable effects on the anticipatory and consummatory  phases in reward-related brain regions. Specifically, we expected reduced  striatal responsiveness during reward consumption (mirroring patterns previously  observed in clinical depression) and increased striatal activation during reward  anticipation consistent with non-human findings. Supporting our hypotheses,  significant Phase (Anticipation/Consumption)×Stress (Stress/No-stress)  interactions emerged in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, caudate and amygdala.  Post hoc tests revealed that stress increased striatal and amygdalar activation  during anticipation but decreased striatal activation during consumption.  Importantly, stress-induced striatal blunting was similar to the profile observed  in clinical depression under baseline (no-stress) conditions in prior studies.  Given that stress is a pivotal vulnerability factor for depression, these results  offer insight to better understand the etiology of this prevalent disorder.},

However, most existing approaches  can be used appropriately only when the image is highly smoothed in the spatial  domain. Unfortunately, spatial smoothing degrades spatial specificity. Recently,  a threshold-free cluster enhancement technique was proposed which does not  require spatial smoothing, but this method can be used only for group level  analysis. Advances in imaging technology now yield high quality high spatial  resolution imaging data in single subjects and an inference approach that retains  the benefits of greater spatial resolution is called for. In this work, we  present a new CST with a correction for voxelation to address this problem. The  theoretical formulation of the new approach based on Gaussian random fields is  developed to estimate statistical significance using 3D statistical parametric  maps without assuming spatial smoothness. Simulated phantom and resting-state  fMRI experimental data are then used to compare the voxelation-corrected  procedure to the widely used standard random field theory. Unlike standard random  field theory approaches, which require heavy spatial smoothing, the new approach  has a higher sensitivity for localizing activation regions without the  requirement of spatial smoothness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) are characterized by maladaptive responses to both positive and negative outcomes, which have been  linked to localized abnormal activations in cortical and striatal brain regions.  However, the exact neural circuitry implicated in such abnormalities remains  largely unexplored. METHOD: In this study 26 unmedicated adults with MDD and 29  matched healthy controls (HCs) completed a monetary incentive delay task during  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Psychophysiological interaction  (PPI) analyses probed group differences in connectivity separately in response to  positive and negative outcomes (i.e. monetary gains and penalties). RESULTS:  Relative to HCs, MDD subjects displayed decreased connectivity between the  caudate and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in response to monetary  gains, yet increased connectivity between the caudate and a different, more  rostral, dACC subregion in response to monetary penalties. Moreover, exploratory  analyses of 14 MDD patients who completed a 12-week, double-blind,  placebo-controlled clinical trial after the baseline fMRI scans indicated that a  more normative pattern of cortico-striatal connectivity pre-treatment was  associated with greater improvement in symptoms 12 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS:  These results identify the caudate as a region with dissociable  incentive-dependent dACC connectivity abnormalities in MDD, and provide initial  evidence that cortico-striatal circuitry may play a role in MDD treatment  response. Given the role of cortico-striatal circuitry in encoding action-outcome  contingencies, such dysregulated connectivity may relate to the prominent  disruptions in goal-directed behavior that characterize MDD.},

	abstract = {Two powerful methods for statistical inference on MRI brain images have been proposed recently, a non-stationary voxelation-corrected cluster-size test (CST)  based on random field theory and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) based  on calculating the level of local support for a cluster, then using permutation  testing for inference. Unlike other statistical approaches, these two methods do  not rest on the assumptions of a uniform and high degree of spatial smoothness of  the statistic image. Thus, they are strongly recommended for group-level fMRI  analysis compared to other statistical methods. In this work, the non-stationary  voxelation-corrected CST and TFCE methods for group-level analysis were evaluated  for both stationary and non-stationary images under varying smoothness levels,  degrees of freedom and signal to noise ratios. Our results suggest that, both  methods provide adequate control for the number of voxel-wise statistical tests  being performed during inference on fMRI data and they are both superior to  current CSTs implemented in popular MRI data analysis software packages. However,  TFCE is more sensitive and stable for group-level analysis of VBM data. Thus, the  voxelation-corrected CST approach may confer some advantages by being  computationally less demanding for fMRI data analysis than TFCE with permutation  testing and by also being applicable for single-subject fMRI analyses, while the  TFCE approach is advantageous for VBM data.

	abstract = {A decade of research and development in resting-state functional MRI (RSfMRI) has opened new translational and clinical research frontiers. This review aims to  bridge between technical and clinical researchers who seek reliable neuroimaging  biomarkers for studying drug interactions with the brain. About 85 pharma-RSfMRI  studies using BOLD signal (75\% of all) or arterial spin labeling (ASL) were  surveyed to investigate the acute effects of psychoactive drugs. Experimental  designs and objectives include drug fingerprinting dose-response evaluation,  biomarker validation and calibration, and translational studies. Common  biomarkers in these studies include functional connectivity, graph metrics,  cerebral blood flow and the amplitude and spectrum of BOLD fluctuations. Overall,  RSfMRI-derived biomarkers seem to be sensitive to spatiotemporal dynamics of drug  interactions with the brain. However, drugs cause both central and peripheral  effects, thus exacerbate difficulties related to biological confounds, structured  noise from motion and physiological confounds, as well as modeling and inference  testing. Currently, these issues are not well explored, and heterogeneities in  experimental design, data acquisition and preprocessing make comparative or  meta-analysis of existing reports impossible. A unifying collaborative framework  for data-sharing and data-mining is thus necessary for investigating the  commonalities and differences in biomarker sensitivity and specificity, and  establishing guidelines. Multimodal datasets including sham-placebo or active  control sessions and repeated measurements of various psychometric,  physiological, metabolic and neuroimaging phenotypes are essential for  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and interpretation of the findings. We  provide a list of basic minimum and advanced options that can be considered in  design and analyses of future pharma-RSfMRI studies.

As a result, parcellation of the human brain has drawn considerable  attention in the field of neuroscience. The thalamus is known as a relay in the  human brain, with its nuclei sending fibers to the cortical and subcortical  regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer a way to  parcellate the thalamus in vivo based on its connectivity properties. However,  the parcellations from previous studies show that both the number and the  distribution of thalamic subdivisions vary with different cortical segmentation  methods. In this study, we used an unsupervised clustering method that does not  rely on a priori information of the cortical segmentation to parcellate the  thalamus. Instead, this approach is based on the intrinsic resting-state  functional connectivity profiles of the thalamus with the whole brain. A series  of cluster solutions were obtained, and an optimal solution was determined.  Furthermore, the validity of our parcellation was investigated through the  following: (1) identifying specific resting-state connectivity patterns of  thalamic parcels with different brain networks and (2) investigating the task  activation and psychophysiological interactions of specific thalamic clusters  during 8-Hz flashing checkerboard stimulation with simultaneous finger tapping.  Together, the current study provides a reliable parcellation of the thalamus and  enhances our understating of thalamic. Furthermore, the current study provides a  framework for parcellation that could be potentially extended to other  subcortical and cortical regions.},

	abstract = {Human brain networks mediating interoceptive, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of glycemic control are not well studied. Using group independent component  analysis with dual-regression approach of functional magnetic resonance imaging  data, we examined the functional connectivity changes of large-scale resting  state networks during sequential euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamp studies in  patients with type 1 diabetes and nondiabetic controls and how these changes  during hypoglycemia were related to symptoms of hypoglycemia awareness and to  concurrent glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. During hypoglycemia, diabetic  patients showed increased functional connectivity of the right anterior insula  and the prefrontal cortex within the executive control network, which was  associated with higher HbA1c. Controls showed decreased functional connectivity  of the right anterior insula with the cerebellum/basal ganglia network and of  temporal regions within the temporal pole network and increased functional  connectivity in the default mode and sensorimotor networks. Functional  connectivity reductions in the right basal ganglia were correlated with increases  of self-reported hypoglycemic symptoms in controls but not in patients. Resting  state networks that showed different group functional connectivity during  hypoglycemia may be most sensitive to glycemic environment, and their  connectivity patterns may have adapted to repeated glycemic excursions present in  type 1 diabetes. Our results suggest that basal ganglia and insula mediation of  interoceptive awareness during hypoglycemia is altered in type 1 diabetes. These  changes could be neuroplastic adaptations to frequent hypoglycemic experiences.  Functional connectivity changes in the insula and prefrontal cognitive networks  could also reflect an adaptation to changes in brain metabolic pathways  associated with chronic hyperglycemia. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The major factor  limiting improved glucose control in type 1 diabetes is the significant increase  in hypoglycemia associated with insulin treatment. Repeated exposure to  hypoglycemia alters patients' ability to recognize the autonomic and  neuroglycopenic symptoms associated with low plasma glucose levels. We examined  brain resting state networks during the induction of hypoglycemia in diabetic and  control subjects and found differences in networks involved in sensorimotor  function, cognition, and interoceptive awareness that were related to chronic  levels of glycemic control. These findings identify brain regions that are  sensitive to variations in plasma glucose levels and may also provide a basis for  understanding the mechanisms underlying the increased incidence of cognitive  impairment and affective disorders seen in patients with diabetes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of marijuana (MJ) use among youth and its legalization for medical or recreational use has intensified public health endeavors of  understanding MJ effects on brain structure and function. Studies indicate that  MJ use is related to impaired cognitive performance, and altered functional brain  activation and chemistry in adolescents and adults, but MJ effects on brain  morphology in emerging adults are less understood. METHODS: Fifteen MJ users (age  21.8±3.6, 2 females) and 15 non-user (NU) participants (age 22.3±3.5, 2 females)  were included, demographically matched on age, education and alcohol use.  High-resolution structural MR images were acquired at 3Tesla. Cortical thickness  (CT) and volumetric analyses were performed using Freesurfer. A priori regions of  interest (ROI) included orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices, amygdala,  hippocampus and thalamus. RESULTS: Whole brain CT analysis did not result in  significant group differences in a priori ROIs but revealed MJ users had  significantly less CT (i.e., thinness) in right fusiform gyrus (rFG) compared to  NU (p{\textless}0.05). Thalamic volume was significantly smaller in MJ users compared to NU  (right, p=0.05; left, p=0.01) and associated with greater non-planning (p{\textless}0.01)  and overall impulsivity (p=0.04). There were no other group differences.  CONCLUSIONS: RFG cortical thinness and smaller thalamic volume in emerging adults  is associated with MJ abuse. Furthermore, smaller thalamic volume associated with  greater impulsivity contributes to growing evidence that the thalamus is  neurobiologically perturbed by MJ use. Collectively, altered thalamic and rFG  structural integrity may interfere with their known roles in regulating  visuoperceptual and object information processing.},

	abstract = {Face detection, the perceptual capacity to identify a visual stimulus as a face before probing deeper into specific attributes (such as its identity or emotion),  is essential for social functioning. Despite the importance of this functional  capacity, face detection and its underlying brain mechanisms are not well  understood. This study evaluated the roles that the cortical face processing  system, which is identified largely through studying other aspects of face  perception, play in face detection. Specifically, we used functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the activations of the fusifom face area  (FFA), occipital face area (OFA) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) when face  detection was isolated from other aspects of face perception and when face  detection was perceptually-equated across individual human participants (n=20).  During face detection, FFA and OFA were significantly activated, even for stimuli  presented at perceptual-threshold levels, whereas STS was not. During tree  detection, however, FFA and OFA were responsive only for highly salient (i.e.,  high contrast) stimuli. Moreover, activation of FFA during face detection  predicted a significant portion of the perceptual performance levels that were  determined psychophysically for each participant. This pattern of result  indicates that FFA and OFA have a greater sensitivity to face detection signals  and selectively support the initial process of face vs. non-face object  perception.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most studies of brain white matter (WM) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have focused on combat trauma, and often were confounded by  neurological and substance dependence comorbidity. This study used tract-based  spatial statistics (TBSS) and probabilistic tractography to characterize WM  microstructure in a mixed-sex community sample of PTSD patients exposed to  diverse and multiple traumas, and in trauma-exposed normal comparison (TENC)  subjects. METHODS: TBSS compared diffusion measures between 20 adults with DSM-IV  PTSD and 17 TENC, using a whole-brain voxel-wise approach. Probabilistic  tractography using Freesurfer's TRACULA was employed to measure diffusion tensor  imaging (DTI) metrics within anatomically defined pathways. DTI metrics were  compared between groups and correlated with PTSD symptom severity and trauma  load. RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, and motion, PTSD subjects had  significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in a left frontal lobe cluster  compared with TENC, at p {\textless} .05, family-wise error corrected. Tractography  identified significant group differences in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus  (ILF), including lower FA and higher radial diffusivity in PTSD compared with  TENC. Within the PTSD group, FA values were not correlated with symptom severity  or trauma load. Results remained significant after removing participants using  psychotropic medication or those with comorbid major depression. CONCLUSIONS:  PTSD patients had reduced WM integrity in left hemisphere frontal WM and  temporal-occipital WM tracts, compared to trauma-exposed controls. Reduced  frontal FA is consistent with compromised top-down attentional control and  emotion regulation in PTSD, while reduced ILF FA may be related to sensory  processing and gating abnormalities in this disorder.},

	abstract = {Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is one of the most popular techniques for the analysis of resting state FMRI data because it has several advantageous  properties when compared with other techniques. Most notably, in contrast to a  conventional seed-based correlation analysis, it is model-free and multivariate,  thus switching the focus from evaluating the functional connectivity of single  brain regions identified a priori to evaluating brain connectivity in terms of  all brain resting state networks (RSNs) that simultaneously engage in oscillatory  activity. Furthermore, typical seed-based analysis characterizes RSNs in terms of  spatially distributed patterns of correlation (typically by means of simple  Pearson's coefficients) and thereby confounds together amplitude information of  oscillatory activity and noise. ICA and other regression techniques, on the other  hand, retain magnitude information and therefore can be sensitive to both changes  in the spatially distributed nature of correlations (differences in the spatial  pattern or "shape") as well as the amplitude of the network activity.  Furthermore, motion can mimic amplitude effects so it is crucial to use a  technique that retains such information to ensure that connectivity differences  are accurately localized. In this work, we investigate the dual regression  approach that is frequently applied with group ICA to assess group differences in  resting state functional connectivity of brain networks. We show how ignoring  amplitude effects and how excessive motion corrupts connectivity maps and results  in spurious connectivity differences. We also show how to implement the dual  regression to retain amplitude information and how to use dual regression outputs  to identify potential motion effects. Two key findings are that using a technique  that retains magnitude information, e.g., dual regression, and using strict  motion criteria are crucial for controlling both network amplitude and  motion-related amplitude effects, respectively, in resting state connectivity  analyses. We illustrate these concepts using realistic simulated resting state  FMRI data and in vivo data acquired in healthy subjects and patients with bipolar  disorder and schizophrenia.},

We also investigated the  association between resting functional connectivity and neural responses (fMRI)  elicited by a face detection paradigm in a partially overlapping sample (Maher et  al., 2016) that used stimuli equated for lower-level perceptual abilities. Group  differences in functional connectivity were found in right FFA only; controls  showed significantly stronger functional connectivity to an early visual cortical  network. Functional connectivity in right FFA was associated with (a) neural  responses during face detection in controls only, and (b) perceptual detection  thresholds for faces in patients only. The finding of impaired functional  connectivity for right FFA (but not other queried domain-specific regions)  converges with findings investigating face detection in an overlapping sample in  which dysfunction was found exclusively for right FFA in schizophrenia during  face detection.},

Although EI plays an  important role in mental health and success in academic, professional and social  realms, the neurocircuitry underlying this capacity remains poorly characterized,  and no study to date has yet examined the relationship between EI and intrinsic  neural network function. Here, in a sample of 54 healthy individuals (28 women,  26 men), we apply independent components analysis (ICA) with dual regression to  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired while subjects were  resting in the scanner to investigate brain circuits (intrinsic resting state  networks) whose activity is associated with greater self-reported (i.e. Trait)  and objectively measured (i.e. Ability) EI. We show that higher Ability EI, but  not Trait EI, is associated with stronger negatively correlated spontaneous fMRI  signals between the basal ganglia/limbic network (BGN) and posterior default mode  network (DMN), and regions involved in emotional processing and regulation.  Importantly, these findings suggest that the functional connectivity within and  between intrinsic networks associated with mentation, affective regulation,  emotion processing, and reward are strongly related to ability EI.},

	abstract = {The transition to college is associated with an increase in heavy episodic alcohol use, or binge drinking, during a time when the prefrontal cortex and  prefrontal-limbic circuitry continue to mature. Traits associated with this  immaturity, including impulsivity in emotional contexts, may contribute to risky  and heavy episodic alcohol consumption. The current study used blood oxygen level  dependent (BOLD) multiband functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess  brain activation during a task that required participants to ignore background  images with positive, negative, or neutral emotional valence while performing an  inhibitory control task (Go-NoGo). Subjects were 23 college freshmen (seven male,  18-20 years) who engaged in a range of drinking behavior (past 3 months' binge  episodes range = 0-19, mean = 4.6, total drinks consumed range = 0-104, mean =  32.0). Brain activation on inhibitory trials (NoGo) was contrasted between  negative and neutral conditions and between positive and neutral conditions using  non-parametric testing (5000 permutations) and cluster-based thresholding (z =  2.3), p ≤ 0.05 corrected. Results showed that a higher recent incidence of binge  drinking was significantly associated with decreased activation of dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC), brain regions strongly implicated in executive  functioning, during negative relative to neutral inhibitory trials. No  significant associations between binge drinking and brain activation were  observed for positive relative to neutral images. While task performance was not  significantly associated with binge drinking in this sample, subjects with  heavier recent binge drinking showed decreased recruitment of executive control  regions under negative versus neutral distractor conditions. These findings  suggest that in young adults with heavier recent binge drinking, processing of  negative emotional images interferes more with inhibitory control neurocircuitry  than in young adults who do not binge drink often. This pattern of altered  frontal lobe activation associated with binge drinking may serve as an early  marker of risk for future self-regulation deficits that could lead to problematic  alcohol use. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the impact  of emotion on cognitive control and associated brain functioning in binge  drinking behaviors among young adults.},

	abstract = {Focusing on sex differences is necessary to fully understand basic neurobiological processes such as the engagement of large-scale brain networks  involved in attention. Prior work suggests that women show enhanced attention  during tasks of reward/punishment relative to men. Yet, sex differences in the  engagement of neural networks sub serving internal and external focus has been  unexplored in regard to reward and punishment. Using data from a large sample (n  = 190) of healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project, we investigated  sex differences in default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN),  and frontal parietal network (FPN) activation during exposure to reward and  punishment. To determine if sex differences are specific to valenced stimuli, we  analyzed network activation during working memory. Results indicate that,  relative to men, women have increased suppression of the DMN and greater  activation of the DAN during exposure to reward and punishment. Given the  relative roles of these networks in internal (DMN) and external (DAN) attention,  this pattern of activation suggests that women have enhanced external attention  to reward and punishment. In contrast, there were no sex differences in network  activation during working memory, indicating that this sex difference is specific  to the processing of reward and punishment. These findings suggest a  neurobiological explanation for prior work showing women have greater sensitivity  to reward/punishment and are more prone to psychiatric disorders characterized by  enhanced attention to such stimuli. Furthermore, given the large sample from the  Human Connectome Project, the current findings provide general implications for  the study of sex as a biological variable in investigation of reward processes.},

	abstract = {The frontal cortex undergoes substantial structural and functional changes during adolescence and significant developmental changes also occur in the hippocampus.  Both of these regions are notably vulnerable to alcohol and other substance use,  which is typically initiated during adolescence. Identifying measures of brain  function during adolescence, particularly before initiation of drug or alcohol  use, is critical to understanding how such behaviors may affect brain  development, especially in these vulnerable brain regions. While there is a  substantial developmental literature on adolescent working memory, less is known  about spatial memory. Thus, a virtual Morris water task (vMWT) was applied to  probe function of the adolescent hippocampus. Multiband blood oxygen level  dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired  at 3T during task performance. Participants included 32 healthy, alcohol- and  drug-naïve adolescents, 13-14 years old, examined at baseline of a 3-year  longitudinal MRI study. Significantly greater BOLD activation was observed in the  hippocampus and surrounding areas, and in prefrontal regions involved in  executive function, during retrieval relative to motor performance. In contrast,  significantly greater BOLD activation was observed in components of the default  mode network, including frontal medial cortex, during the motor condition (when  task demands were minimal) relative to the retrieval condition. Worse performance  (longer path length) during retrieval was associated with greater activation of  angular gyrus/supramarginal gyrus, whereas worse performance (longer path  length/latency) during motor control was associated with less activation of  frontal pole. Furthermore, while latency (time to complete task) was greater in  females than in males, there were no sex differences in path length (accuracy),  suggesting that females required more time to navigate the virtual environment,  but did so as effectively as males. These findings demonstrate that performance  of the vMWT elicits hippocampal and prefrontal activation patterns in early  adolescence, similar to activation observed during spatial memory retrieval in  adults. Given that this task is sensitive to hippocampal function, and that the  adolescent hippocampus is notably vulnerable to the effects of alcohol and other  substances, data acquired using this task during healthy adolescent development  may provide a framework for understanding neurobiological impact of later  initiation of use.},

However, much  less attention has been given to use of open access neuroimaging datasets to  conduct replication studies. A major barrier to reproducing neuroimaging studies  is their high cost, in money and labor, and utilizing such datasets is an obvious  solution for breaking down this barrier.

Although the  stability of the ICA temporal courses differs from that of spatial components,  temporal stability has not been considered during dimensionality decisions. NEW  METHOD: The current study aims to (1) develop an algorithm to incorporate  temporal course stability into dimensionality selection and (2) test the impact  of temporal course on the stability of the ICA decomposition of fMRI data via  tensor clustering. Resting state fMRI data were analyzed with two popular ICA  algorithms, InfomaxICA and FastICA, using our new method and results were  compared with model order selection based on spatial or temporal criteria alone.  RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering indicated that the stability of the ICA  decomposition incorporating spatiotemporal tensor information performed similarly  when compared to current best practice. However, we found that component  spatiotemporal stability and convergence of the model varied significantly with  model order. Considering both may lead to methodological improvements for  determining ICA model order. Selected components were also significantly  associated with relevant behavioral variables. Comparison with Existing Method:  The Kullback-Leibler information criterion algorithm suggests the optimal model  order for group ICA is 40, compared to the proposed method with an optimal model  order of 20.

Neuroanatomically, developmentally  normative risk-taking behavior parallels an imbalance between more protracted  development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and earlier development of limbic  regions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived volumetric properties were  obtained for these structures in FH+ and FH- adolescents. METHODS: Forty-two  substance-naïve adolescents (13- to 14-year-olds), stratified into FH+ (N = 19,  13 girls) and FH- (N = 23, 11 girls) age/handedness-matched groups, completed MRI  scanning at 3.0T, as well as cognitive and clinical testing. T1 images were  processed using FreeSurfer to measure PFC and hippocampi/amygdalae  subfields/nuclei volumes. RESULTS: FH+ status was associated with larger  hippocampal/amygdala volumes (p {\textless} 0.05), relative to FH- adolescents, with right  amygdala results appearing to be driven by FH+ boys. Volumetric differences also  were positively associated with family history density (p {\textless} 0.05) of having an  AUD. Larger subfields/nuclei volumes were associated with higher anxiety levels  and worse auditory verbal learning performance (p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: FH+ risk  for AUD is detectable via neuromorphometric characteristics, which precede  alcohol use onset and the potential onset of a later AUD, that are associated  with emotional and cognitive measures. It is plausible that the development of  limbic regions might be altered in FH+ youth, even prior to the onset of alcohol  use, which could increase later risk. Thus, targeted preventative measures are  warranted that serve to delay the onset of alcohol use in youth, particularly in  those who are FH+ for an AUD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The insula has a well-established role in nicotine dependence and is a node of the salience network, which integrates internal and external  information to guide behavior. Recent findings reveal that internal and external  processing occurs in the ventral anterior insula (vAI) and dorsal anterior insula  (dAI), respectively. Whether vAI/dAI network connectivity differentially reflects  internally generated craving and externally triggered smoking cue reactivity was  tested. METHODS: Thirty-six male and female nicotine-dependent individuals smoked  1 hour before functional magnetic resonance imaging. Baseline craving was  measured, followed by resting-state and smoking cue reactivity scans and then  another assessment of craving. Craving and cue reactivity interactions were  measured by focusing on specific nodes of the salience network: the vAI/dAI and  anterior cingulate cortex. RESULTS: Resting-state vAI/dAI networks overlapped  with the prototypical salience network, yet they possessed distinct patterns,  linking the vAI with nodes of the internally focused default mode network and the  dAI with nodes of the external, goal-related frontoparietal network. Internally  generated baseline craving was associated with enhanced vAI connectivity, whereas  rostral anterior cingulate cortex reactivity to external smoking cues was  associated with greater dAI connectivity. We also found that cue reactivity in  the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was associated with a rise in subjective  cue-induced craving, whereas baseline subjective craving did not influence brain  cue reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that brain reactivity to smoking  cues is associated with a subsequent increase in craving. In addition, separate  insula networks have a role in an individual's vulnerability to internally  related craving and externally triggered cue reactivity, which could guide the  development of new, neurobiologically targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although aspects of brain morphology have been associated with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), limited work has investigated  multimodal patterns in brain morphology that are linked to acute posttraumatic  stress severity. In the present study, we utilized multimodal magnetic resonance  imaging to investigate if structural covariance networks (SCNs) assessed acutely  following trauma were linked to acute posttraumatic stress severity. METHODS:  Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were collected around 1 month after  civilian trauma exposure in 78 participants. Multimodal magnetic resonance  imaging data fusion was completed to identify combinations of SCNs, termed  structural covariance profiles (SCPs), related to acute posttraumatic stress  severity collected at 1 month. Analyses assessed the relationship between  participant SCP loadings, acute posttraumatic stress severity, the change in  posttraumatic stress severity from 1 to 12 months, and depressive symptoms.  RESULTS: We identified an SCP that reflected greater gray matter properties of  the anterior temporal lobe, fusiform face area, and visual cortex (i.e., the  ventral visual stream) that varied curvilinearly with acute posttraumatic stress  severity and the change in PTSD symptom severity from 1 to 12 months. The SCP was  not associated with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We identified combinations  of multimodal SCNs that are related to variability in PTSD symptoms in the early  aftermath of trauma. The identified SCNs may reflect patterns of neuroanatomical  organization that provide unique insight into acute posttraumatic stress.  Furthermore, these multimodal SCNs may be potential candidates for neural markers  of susceptibility to both acute posttraumatic stress and the future development  of PTSD.},

Structural and functional alterations in hippocampus and frontal lobe have been  reported in MDD, which likely contribute to the multifaceted nature of MDD. One  area impacted by MDD is hippocampal-mediated memory, which can be probed using a  spatial virtual Morris water task (MWT). Women (n=24) across a spectrum of  depression severity underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during  MWT. Depression severity, assessed via Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), was  examined relative to brain activation during task performance. Significant brain  activation was evident in areas traditionally implicated in spatial memory  processing, including right hippocampus and frontal lobe regions, for retrieval {\textgreater}  motor contrast. When BDI was included as a regressor, significantly less  functional activation was evident in left hippocampus, and other non-frontal,  task relevant regions for retrieval {\textgreater} rest contrast. Consistent with previous  studies, depression severity was associated with functional alterations observed  during spatial memory performance. These findings may contribute to understanding  neurobiological underpinnings of depression severity and associated memory  impairments, which may have implications for treatment approaches aimed at  alleviating effects of depression in women.},

Extensive studies have demonstrated that PD may lead to  variation of brain activity in different frequency bands. However, frequency  specific dynamic alterations of PD have not yet been explored. NEW METHOD: In  order to address this gap, a novel sparse nonnegative tensor decomposition (SNTD)  method was used to estimate frequency specific co-activation patterns (CAP). The  difference between PD and healthy controls (HC) are investigated with the  proposed framework. RESULT: The difference between PD and HC mainly exists at  frequency band 0.04-0.1 Hz in basal ganglia. We also found that the average  intensity of PD in this frequency band is significantly correlated with the Hoehn  and Yahr scale. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Compared with conventional CAP  approach, SNTD estimates frequency specific CAPs that show alterations in PD  patients. CONCLUSION: SNTD provides an alternative to K-means clustering used in  conventional CAP analysis. With the proposed framework, frequency specific CAPs  are extracted, and alterations in PD patients are also successfully discovered.},

Advances in multimodal imaging allow inferences  between regional neurotransmitter function and activation in circuits linked to  MDD, which could inform treatment development. The current study investigated the  role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in stress circuitry in females with  current and remitted MDD. Multimodal imaging data were analyzed from 49 young  female adults across three groups (current MDD, remitted MDD (rMDD), and healthy  controls). GABA was assessed at baseline using magnetic resonance spectroscopy,  and functional MRI data were collected before, during, and after an acute  stressor and analyzed using a network modeling approach. The MDD group showed an  overall lower cortisol response than the rMDD group and lower rostral anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA than healthy controls. Across groups, stress  decreased activation in the frontoparietal network (FPN) but increased activation  in the default mode network (DMN) and a network encompassing the ventromedial  prefrontal cortex-striatum-anterior cingulate cortex (vmPFC-Str-ACC). Relative to  controls, the MDD and rMDD groups were characterized by decreased FPN and  salience network (SN) activation overall. Rostral ACC GABA was positively  associated with connectivity between an overlapping limbic network  (Temporal-Insula-Amygdala) and two other circuits (FPN and DMN). Collectively,  these findings indicate that reduced GABA in females with MDD was associated with  connectivity differences within and across key networks implicated in depression.  GABAergic treatments for MDD might alleviate stress circuitry abnormalities in  females.},

We aimed to determine the  feasibility of a brief, 4-week Mentalizing Imagery Therapy intervention, which  couples mindfulness with guided imagery practices aimed at bolstering mentalizing  capacity, to reduce caregiver psychological symptoms and to explore potential  impact on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity. METHODS: Twenty-four  family dementia caregivers with moderate depression symptoms (a score of 10 in  Patient Health Questionnaire-9) were assigned to either group Mentalizing Imagery  Therapy (MIT, n = 12) or a waitlist augmented by optional relaxation exercises (n  = 12). Participants completed questionnaires to measure depression and anxiety at  baseline and followup, and those eligible also underwent resting state functional  magnetic resonance (fMRI) brain imaging at these time points. RESULTS: Eleven of  12 caregivers assigned to MIT completed the intervention and attended weekly  groups 98\% of the time. MIT home practice logs indicated average practice of 5 ±  2 sessions per week for 23 ± 8 min per session. All participants in waitlist  completed the post-assessment. MIT participants exhibited significantly greater  improvement than waitlist on self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms  (p{\textless}.05) after 4 weeks. Neuroimaging results revealed increased dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex connectivity with a putative emotion regulation network in the  MIT group (p = .05) but not in waitlist (p = 1.0). LIMITATIONS: Sample size  limitations necessitate validation of findings in larger, randomized controlled  trials.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transition to college is associated with increased risk of alcohol misuse and a consequent increase in negative, alcohol-related social and  health impacts. Traits associated with ongoing brain maturation during this  period, including impulsivity in emotional contexts, could contribute to risky  alcohol use. METHODS: This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study  examined brain network activation strength during an emotional inhibitory control  task (Go-NoGo), which required participants to ignore background images with  negative or neutral emotional valence during performance. Participants were 60  college freshmen (aged 18-20 years, 33 women). Survey measures, completed at  baseline and one-year follow-up (follow-up n = 52, 29 women), assessed alcohol  misuse alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT), alcohol/substance use  counseling center assessment of psychological symptoms (C-CAPS), and negative  consequences of alcohol use young adult alcohol consequences questionnaire  (YAACQ). Measures were examined relative to network activation strength, on the  Negative NoGo {\textgreater} Neutral NoGo contrast, of four large-scale brain networks  implicated in top-down regulation of cognition and attention: right and left  lateral frontoparietal networks (rL-FPN; lL-FPN), dorsal attention network (DAN),  and salience network (SN). RESULTS: Activation strength of DAN was negatively  associated with scores on the AUDIT (p = 0.013) and YAACQ (p = 0.004) at  baseline, and with C-CAPS score at baseline and follow-up (p = 0.002; p = 0.005),  and positively associated with accuracy on NoGo trials with negative backgrounds  (p = 0.014). Activation strength of rL-FPN was positively associated with C-CAPS  score at follow-up (p = 0.003). SN activation strength was negatively associated  with accuracy on NoGo trials with negative (p {\textless} 0.001) and neutral (p = 0.002)  backgrounds and with the accuracy difference between negative versus neutral NoGo  trials (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that less engagement of  large-scale brain circuitry that supports top-down attentional control,  specifically during negative emotions, is associated with more problematic  drinking in emerging adults who attend college. This pattern of network  activation may serve as a risk marker for ongoing self-regulation deficits during  negative emotion that could increase risk of problematic alcohol use and negative  impacts of drinking.},

However, scanner confounds hinder pooling data collected on different scanners or  across software and hardware upgrades on the same scanner, even when all  acquisition protocols are harmonized. These confounds reduce power and can lead  to spurious findings. Unfortunately, methods to address this problem are scant.  In this study, we propose a novel denoising approach that implements a  data-driven linked independent component analysis (LICA) to identify  scanner-related effects for removal from multimodal MRI to denoise scanner  effects. We utilized multi-study data to test our proposed method that were  collected on a single 3T scanner, pre- and post-software and major hardware  upgrades and using different acquisition parameters. Our proposed denoising  method shows a greater reduction of scanner-related variance compared with  standard GLM confound regression or ICA-based single-modality denoising. Although  we did not test it here, for combining data across different scanners, LICA  should prove even better at identifying scanner effects as between-scanner  variability is generally much larger than within-scanner variability. Our method  has great promise for denoising scanner effects in multi-study and in large-scale  multi-site studies that may be confounded by scanner differences.},

Model order selection (MOS)  algorithms have been used to determine the number of estimated components.  However, simulations show that even when the model order equals the number of  simulated signal sources, traditional ICA algorithms may misestimate the spatial  maps of the signal sources. In principle, increasing model order will consider  more potential information in the estimation, and should therefore produce more  accurate results. However, this strategy may not work for fMRI because  large-scale networks are widely spatially distributed and thus have increased  mutual information with noise. As such, conventional ICA algorithms with high  model orders may not extract these components at all. This conflict makes the  selection of model order a problem. We present a new strategy for model order  free ICA, called Snowball ICA, that obviates these issues. The algorithm collects  all information for each network from fMRI data without the limitations of  network scale. Using simulations and in vivo resting-state fMRI data, our results  show that component estimation using Snowball ICA is more accurate than  traditional ICA.

Creatine kinase (CK) is pivotal in  providing adenosine triphosphate in the cell and maintaining its levels when  energy demand is increased. However, the activity of CK has not been investigated  in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHODS: Using  in vivo phosphorus magnetization transfer spectroscopy, we measured CK  first-order forward rate constant (k (f) ) in the frontal lobe, in patients with  first-episode psychosis (FEP; n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 34), at rest.  RESULTS: CK k (f) was significantly reduced in FEP compared to healthy controls.  There were no differences in other energy metabolism-related measures, including  phosphocreatine (PCr) or ATP, between groups. We also found increase in  glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine, a putative membrane breakdown product, in patients.  CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that brain bioenergetic  abnormalities are already present early in the course of schizophrenia spectrum  disorders. Future research is needed to identify the relationship of reduced CK k  (f) with psychotic symptoms and to test treatment alternatives targeting this  pathway. Increased glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine is consistent with earlier  studies in medication-naïve patients and later studies in first-episode  schizophrenia, and suggest enhanced synaptic pruning.},

However, limited studies have used brain structural covariance  networks (SCNs) for subtyping MDD. METHODS: This study included 145 unmedicated  patients with MDD and 206 demographically matched healthy control subjects, who  underwent a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan and a comprehensive  neurocognitive battery. Patterns of structural covariance were identified using  source-based morphometry across both patients with MDD and healthy control  subjects. K-means clustering algorithms were applied on dysregulated structural  networks in MDD to identify potential MDD subtypes. Finally, clinical and  neurocognitive measures were compared between identified subgroups to elucidate  the profile of these MDD subtypes. RESULTS: Source-based morphometry across all  individuals identified 28 whole-brain SCNs that encompassed the prefrontal,  anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices; basal ganglia; and cerebellar,  visual, and motor regions. Compared with healthy control subjects, individuals  with MDD showed lower structural network integrity in three networks including  default mode, ventromedial prefrontal cortical, and salience networks. Clustering  analysis revealed two MDD subtypes based on the patterns of structural network  abnormalities in these three networks. Further profiling revealed that patients  in subtype 1 had younger age of onset and more symptom severity as well as  greater deficits in cognitive performance than patients in subtype 2.  CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we identified two MDD subtypes based on SCNs that differed  in their clinical and cognitive profile. Our results represent a proof-of-concept  framework for leveraging these large-scale SCNs to parse heterogeneity in MDD.},

	abstract = {Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by increased stress sensitivity. Emerging findings in healthy adults suggest that stress responses within  limbic/striatal-prefrontal regions are moderated by sex and unfold over time.  Thus, we hypothesized that stress response abnormalities in MDD might be affected  by sex and stress exposure time. The Montreal Imaging Stress Task was  administered to 124 unmedicated patients with first-episode MDD (76 females) and  243 healthy controls (HC; 137 females) during functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI). Based on prior studies, amygdala, hippocampus, medial  orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex (dlPFC) were selected as a priori regions of interest. In a complementary  approach, we probed the effects of stress on the frontoparietal network (FPN) and  a network including the amygdala, NAc and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Across  groups, males exhibited higher dlPFC activity and right FPN amplitude than  females. Relative to female HCs, the female MDD group had less deactivation in  limbic/striatal regions (amygdala, NAc, hippocampus, Amygdala-NAc-ACC network).  Furthermore, unlike female HCs, the female MDD group failed to show a significant  increase of deactivation over stress exposure time in the amygdala, mOFC and NAc.  Our findings confirm the importance of considering sex differences when  investigating neural stress responses. Case-control differences in neural stress  responses observed in females (but not males) provide insights into sex  differences in the etiology and pathophysiology of depression. The failure to  deactivate limbic/NAc regions in depressed females point to dysfunction of  adaptive stress responses over stress exposure time.},

Between-network connectivity has been shown to be abnormal in both substance use  disorders (SUD) and psychosis. However, none have studied how SUD affects  connectivity between sub-networks of the DMN, SN, and CEN in early stage  psychosis (ESP) patients. In this study, we collected data from 113 ESP patients  and 50 healthy controls to investigate the effect of SUD on between-network  connectivity. In addition, we performed sub-group analysis by exploring whether  past SUD vs current SUD co-morbidity, or diagnosis (affective vs non-affective  psychosis) had a modulatory effect. Connectivity between four network-pairs,  consisting of sub-networks of the SN, CEN, and DMN, was significantly different  between ESP patients and controls. Two patterns of connectivity were observed  when patients were divided into sub-groups with current vs past SUD. In  particular, connectivity between right CEN and the cingulo-opercular salience  sub-network (rCEN-CON) showed a gradient effect where the severity of  abnormalities increased from no history of SUD to past+ to current+. We also  observed diagnosis-specific effects, suggesting non-affective psychosis patients  were particularly vulnerable to effects of substance use on rCEN-CON  connectivity.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Conventional theories of hemispheric emotional valence (HEV) postulate fixed hemispheric differences in emotional processing. Schiffer's dual brain  psychology proposes that there are prominent individual differences with a  substantial subset showing a reversed laterality pattern. He further proposed  that hemispheric differences were more akin to differences in personality than in  emotional processing. This theory is supported by findings that unilateral  treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, are effective if they  accurately target individual differences in laterality. The aim of this paper was  to assess if a computer test of hemispheric emotional valence (CTHEV) could  effectively identify individual differences in HEV and to ascertain if these  individual differences were associated with underlying differences in brain  structure and connectivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CTHEV was administered to  50 (18 male/32 female) right-handed participants, aged 18-19 years, enrolled in a  study assessing the neurobiological effects of childhood maltreatment. Based on a  literature review, we determined whether CTHEV correlated with lateralized  volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and subgenual anterior  cingulate as well as volume of the corpus callosum. RESULTS: CTHEV scores  correlated with laterality indices of the nucleus accumbens (p = 0.00016),  amygdala (p = 0.0138) and hippocampus (p = 0.031). A positive left hemispheric  valence was associated with a larger left-sided nucleus accumbens and hippocampus  and a smaller left amygdala. We identified four eigenvector network centrality  DTI measures that predict CTHEV, most notably the left amygdala, and found that  CTHEV results correlated with total and segment-specific corpus callosal volumes.  CONCLUSION: Individual differences in HEV can be readily assessed by computer  test and correlate with differences in brain structure and connectivity that  could provide a mechanistic understanding. These findings provide further support  for a revised understanding of HEV and provide a tool that could be used to guide  lateralized brain treatments.},

Dissociation and its  trauma-related antecedents disproportionately impact women. However, despite the  gender-related prevalence and high individual and societal costs, dissociation  remains widely underappreciated in clinical practice. Moreover, dissociation  lacks a synthesized neurobiological model across its subtypes. Leveraging the  Triple Network Model of psychopathology, we sought to parse heterogeneity in  dissociative experience by examining functional connectivity of three core  neurocognitive networks as related to: (1) the dimensional dissociation subtypes  of depersonalization/derealization and partially-dissociated intrusions; and, (2)  the diagnostic category of dissociative identity disorder (DID). Participants  were 91 women with and without: a history of childhood trauma, current  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and varied levels of dissociation.  Participants provided clinical data about dissociation, PTSD symptoms, childhood  maltreatment history, and completed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance  imaging scan. We used a novel statistical approach to assess both overlapping and  unique contributions of dissociation subtypes. Covarying for age, childhood  maltreatment and PTSD severity, we found dissociation was linked to  hyperconnectivity within central executive (CEN), default (DN), and salience  networks (SN), and decreased connectivity of CEN and SN with other areas.  Moreover, we isolated unique connectivity markers associated with  depersonalization/derealization in CEN and DN, to partially-dissociated  intrusions in CEN, and to DID in CEN. This suggests dissociation subtypes have  robust functional connectivity signatures that may serve as targets for PTSD/DID  treatment engagement. Our findings underscore dissociation assessment as crucial  in clinical care, in particular, to reduce gender-related health disparities.},

This study evaluated brain activation using functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) during spatial memory performance using a virtual Morris water  task (MWT) and examined the associations between default mode network (DMN)  activation, task performance, and perceived stress and rejection. Functional  magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at 3 Tesla from 59 (34 female)  adolescents (13-14 years). The NIH Emotion Toolbox was used to measure perceived  stress and rejection. During the MWT, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex showed  greater activation during memory retrieval relative to motor performance.  Templates of brain functional networks from the Human Connectome Project study  were used to extract individual participants' brain network activation strengths  for the retrieval {\textgreater} motor contrast for two sub-networks of the default mode  network: medial temporal lobe (MTL-DMN) and dorsomedial prefrontal (dMPFC-DMN).  For the MTL-DMN sub-network only, activation was significantly associated with  worse MWT performance (p = .008) and greater perceived stress (p = .008) and  perceived rejection (p = .002). Further, MWT performance was negatively  associated with perceived rejection (p = .007). These findings suggest that  perceived stress and rejection are related to engagement of MTL-DMN during  spatial memory and that engagement of this network impacts performance. These  findings also demonstrate the utility of examining task-related network  activation strength to identify the impact of perceived stress and rejection on  large-scale brain network functioning during adolescence.},

Mentalizing imagery therapy (MIT)  provides mindfulness and guided imagery skills training to improve balanced  mentalizing and emotion regulation. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to test the  hypotheses that MIT for family caregivers would reduce depression symptoms and  improve positive psychological traits more than a support group (SG), and would  increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity and reduce subgenual  anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) connectivity. METHODS: Forty-six caregivers  participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week MIT group (n =  24) versus an SG (n = 22). Resting state neuroimaging was obtained at baseline  and post-group in 28 caregivers, and questionnaires completed by all  participants. The primary outcome was change in depression; secondary measures  included anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. Brain networks  with participation of DLPFC and sgACC were identified. Connectivity strengths of  DLPFC and sgACC with respective networks were determined with dual regression.  DLPFC connectivity was correlated with mindfulness and depression outcomes.  RESULTS: MIT significantly outperformed SG in improving depression, anxiety,  mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, with moderate to large effect  sizes. Relative to SG, participants in MIT showed significant increases in DLPFC  connectivity - exactly replicating pilot study results - but no change in sgACC.  DLPFC connectivity change correlated positively with mindfulness and negatively  with depression change. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, MIT was superior to SG for  reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and improving positive psychological  traits. Neuroimaging results suggested that strengthening DLPFC connectivity with  an emotion regulation network might be mechanistically related to MIT effects.},

To estimate large-scale brain  networks evoked with naturalistic stimuli, a tensor component analysis (TCA)  based framework was used to characterize shared spatio-temporal patterns across  subjects in a purely data-driven manner. In this framework, a third-order tensor  is constructed from the timeseries extracted from all brain regions from a given  parcellation, for all participants, with modes of the tensor corresponding to  spatial distribution, time series and participants. TCA then reveals spatially  and temporally shared components, i.e., evoked networks with the naturalistic  stimuli, their time courses of activity and subject loadings of each component.  To enhance the reproducibility of the estimation with the adaptive TCA algorithm,  a novel spectral clustering method, tensor spectral clustering, was proposed and  applied to evaluate the stability of the TCA algorithm. We demonstrated the  effectiveness of the proposed framework via simulations and real fMRI data  collected during a motor task with a traditional fMRI study design. We also  applied the proposed framework to fMRI data collected during passive movie  watching to illustrate how reproducible brain networks are evoked by naturalistic  movie viewing.},

	abstract = {Visual components of trauma memories are often vividly re-experienced by survivors with deleterious consequences for normal function. Neuroimaging  research on trauma has primarily focused on threat-processing circuitry as core  to trauma-related dysfunction. Conversely, limited attention has been given to  visual circuitry which may be particularly relevant to posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD). Prior work suggests that the ventral visual stream is directly  related to the cognitive and affective disturbances observed in PTSD and may be  predictive of later symptom expression. The present study used multimodal  magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 278) collected two weeks after trauma  exposure from the AURORA study, a longitudinal, multisite investigation of  adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae. Indices of gray and white matter  were combined using data fusion to identify a structural covariance network (SCN)  of the ventral visual stream 2 weeks after trauma. Participant's loadings on the  SCN were positively associated with both intrusion symptoms and intensity of  nightmares. Further, SCN loadings moderated connectivity between a previously  observed amygdala-hippocampal functional covariance network and the inferior  temporal gyrus. Follow-up MRI data at 6 months showed an inverse relationship  between SCN loadings and negative alterations in cognition in mood. Further,  individuals who showed decreased strength of the SCN between 2 weeks and 6 months  had generally higher PTSD symptom severity over time. The present findings  highlight a role for structural integrity of the ventral visual stream in the  development of PTSD. The ventral visual stream may be particularly important for  the consolidation or retrieval of trauma memories and may contribute to efficient  reactivation of visual components of the trauma memory, thereby exacerbating PTSD  symptoms. Potentially chronic engagement of the network may lead to reduced  structural integrity which becomes a risk factor for lasting PTSD symptoms.},

A larger and more diverse group of participants can  increase the statistical power, enhance the reliability and reproducibility of  neuroimaging research, and obtain findings more representative of the general  population. However, measurement biases caused by site differences in scanners  represent a barrier when pooling data collected from different sites. The  existence of site effects can mask biological effects and lead to spurious  findings. We recently proposed a powerful denoising strategy that implements  dual-projection (DP) theory based on ICA to remove site-related effects from  pooled data, demonstrating the method for simulated and in vivo structural MRI  data. This study investigates the use of our DP-based ICA denoising method for  harmonizing functional MRI (fMRI) data collected from the Autism Brain Imaging  Data Exchange II. After frequency-domain and regional homogeneity analyses, two  modalities, including amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional  homogeneity (ReHo), were used to validate our method. The results indicate that  DP-based ICA denoising method removes unwanted site effects for both two fMRI  modalities, with increases in the significance of the associations between  non-imaging variables (age, sex, etc.) and fMRI measures. In conclusion, our DP  method can be applied to fMRI data in multi-site studies, enabling more accurate  and reliable neuroimaging research findings.},

However, the  scanner/site variability is a significant confound that complicates the  interpretation of the results, so effective and complete removal of the  scanner/site variability is necessary to realise the full advantages of pooling  multi-site datasets. Independent component analysis (ICA) and general linear  model (GLM) based harmonisation methods are the two primary methods used to  eliminate scanner/site effects. Unfortunately, there are challenges with both  ICA-based and GLM-based harmonisation methods to remove site effects completely  when the signals of interest and scanner/site effects-related variables are  correlated, which may occur in neuroscience studies. In this study, we propose an  effective and powerful harmonisation strategy that implements dual projection  (DP) theory based on ICA to remove the scanner/site effects more completely. This  method can separate the signal effects correlated with site variables from the  identified site effects for removal without losing signals of interest. Both  simulations and vivo structural MRI datasets, including a dataset from Autism  Brain Imaging Data Exchange II and a travelling subject dataset from the  Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences, were used to test the performance  of a DP-based ICA harmonisation method. Results show that DP-based ICA  harmonisation has superior performance for removing site effects and enhancing  the sensitivity to detect signals of interest as compared with GLM-based and  conventional ICA harmonisation methods.},

The committee conducted a survey to catalog current  practices in large-scale brain network nomenclature.

This perspective piece includes a selective review of challenges to  this enterprise, including (1) network scale, resolution, and hierarchies; (2)  interindividual variability of networks; (3) dynamics and nonstationarity of  networks; (4) consideration of network affiliations of subcortical structures;  and (5) consideration of multimodal information. We close with minimal reporting  guidelines for the cognitive and network neuroscience communities to adopt.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Preclinical work suggests that excess glucocorticoids and reduced cortical γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may affect sex-dependent differences in brain  regions implicated in stress regulation and depressive phenotypes. The authors  sought to address a critical gap in knowledge, namely, how stress circuitry is  functionally affected by glucocorticoids and GABA in current or remitted major  depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: Multimodal imaging data were collected from  130 young adults (ages 18-25), of whom 44 had current MDD, 42 had remitted MDD,  and 44 were healthy comparison subjects. GABA+ (γ-aminobutyric acid and  macromolecules) was assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and  task-related functional MRI data were collected under acute stress and analyzed  using data-driven network modeling. RESULTS: Across modalities, trait-related  abnormalities emerged. Relative to healthy comparison subjects, both clinical  groups were characterized by lower rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) GABA+  and frontoparietal network amplitude but higher amplitude in salience and  stress-related networks. For the remitted MDD group, differences from the healthy  comparison group emerged in the context of elevated cortisol levels, whereas the  MDD group had lower cortisol levels than the healthy comparison group. In the  comparison group, frontoparietal and stress-related network connectivity was  positively associated with cortisol level (highlighting putative top-down  regulation of stress), but the opposite relationship emerged in the MDD and  remitted MDD groups. Finally, rACC GABA+ was associated with stress-induced  changes in connectivity between overlapping default mode and salience networks.  CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime MDD was characterized by reduced rACC GABA+ as well as  dysregulated cortisol-related interactions between top-down control  (frontoparietal) and threat (task-related) networks. These findings warrant  further investigation of the role of GABA in the vulnerability to and treatment  of MDD.},

	abstract = {The inequitable distribution of economic resources and exposure to adversity between racial groups contributes to mental health disparities within the United  States. Consideration of the potential neurodevelopmental consequences, however,  has been limited particularly for neurocircuitry known to regulate the emotional  response to threat. Characterizing the consequences of inequity on threat  neurocircuitry is critical for robust and generalizable neurobiological models of  psychiatric illness. Here we use data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive  Development Study 4.0 release to investigate the contributions of individual and  neighborhood-level economic resources and exposure to discrimination. We  investigate the potential appearance of race-related differences using both  standard methods and through population-level normative modeling. We show that,  in a sample of white and Black adolescents, racial inequities in socioeconomic  factors largely contribute to the appearance of race-related differences in  cortical thickness of threat neurocircuitry. The race-related differences are  preserved through the use of population-level models and such models also  preserve associations between cortical thickness and specific socioeconomic  factors. The present findings highlight that such socioeconomic inequities  largely underlie race-related differences in brain morphology. The present  findings provide important new insight for the generation of generalizable  neurobiological models of psychiatric illness.},

	doi = {10.1101/2024.06.17.599426},
	abstract = {Decades of neuroscience research has shown that macroscale brain dynamics can be reliably decomposed into a subset of large-scale functional networks, but the  specific spatial topographies of these networks and the names used to describe  them can vary across studies. Such discordance has hampered interpretation and  convergence of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we  have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to  examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging  results and sixteen widely used functional brain atlases, consistent with  recommended reporting standards developed by the Organization for Human Brain  Mapping. The atlases included in the toolbox show some topographical convergence  for specific networks, such as those labeled as default or visual. Network naming  varies across atlases, particularly for networks spanning frontoparietal  association cortices. For this reason, quantitative comparison with multiple  atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging findings. We provide  several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome Project task fMRI  results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to illustrate how  researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through quantitative  evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a convenient  means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine  the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined  maps and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to  incorporate additional atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make  it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a  standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons  between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.},

	abstract = {Menstrual pain is associated with deficits in central pain processing, yet neuroimaging studies to date have all been limited by focusing on group  comparisons of adult women with vs without menstrual pain. This study aimed to  investigate the role of the triple network model (TNM) of brain networks in  adolescent girls with varied menstrual pain severity ratings. One hundred  participants (ages 13-19 years) completed a 6-min resting state functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan and rated menstrual pain severity,  menstrual pain interference, and cumulative menstrual pain exposure. Imaging  analyses included age and gynecological age (years since menarche) as covariates.  Menstrual pain severity was positively associated with functional connectivity  between the cingulo-opercular salience network (cSN) and the sensory processing  regions, limbic regions, and insula, and was also positively associated with  connectivity between the left central executive network (CEN) and posterior  regions. Menstrual pain interference was positively associated with connectivity  between the cSN and widespread brain areas. In addition, menstrual pain  interference was positively associated with connectivity within the left CEN,  whereas connectivity both within the right CEN and between the right CEN and  cortical areas outside the network (including the insula) were negatively  associated with menstrual pain interference. Cumulative menstrual pain exposure  shared a strong negative association with connectivity between the default mode  network and other widespread regions associated with large-scale brain networks.  These findings support a key role for the involvement of TNM brain networks in  menstrual pain characteristics and suggest that alterations in pain processing  exist in adolescents with varying levels of menstrual pain.},
