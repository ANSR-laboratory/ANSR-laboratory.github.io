Adrián Medina, MPH, EdM, is an aspiring physician-scientist with a focus on the integrative study of developmental affective neuroscience, psychiatric epidemiology, and psychopharmacology. Their research centers on understanding how multidimensional traumatic stressors—such as threat, deprivation, and unpredictability—shape psychopathology through neurodevelopmental and epigenetic mechanisms across the lifespan, particularly from the prenatal period to young adulthood. By leveraging computational modeling, big neuroimaging data, and normative modeling, Adrián aims to uncover complex brain-behavior interactions and advance precision medicine approaches that tailor treatments to individual psychopathological profiles. Their work seeks to identify novel therapeutic targets and refine existing treatments to address the nuanced and interconnected aspects of mental disorders more effectively.

In their future clinical practice, Adrián plans to specialize in Neuropsychiatry-Behavioral Neurology, Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics, and Child-Adolescent Psychiatry. They are dedicated to supporting vulnerable youth living with mood, anxiety, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Their vision includes establishing a trauma-informed treatment program that serves children and families from oppressed communities through integrative and culturally sensitive psychopharmacological, psychoeducational, and psychotherapeutic approaches.
