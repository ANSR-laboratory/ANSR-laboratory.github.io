Dr. Lily Cheng’s research focuses on two fundamental questions: How does the brain function during navigation, and how does the environment shape cognition?

To explore the first question, Dr. Cheng investigates individual differences in the perception of distance, direction, and decision-making during wayfinding. Her work examines the neural mechanisms underlying the travel direction system in the human brain through the use of psychophysics, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and computational modeling.

Addressing the second question, Dr. Cheng studies how biased world knowledge impacts cognition. Recognizing that 90% of humans are right-handed and most tools are designed for right-handed use, she examines how this right-handed bias influences cognition across spatial scales. Her research includes testing left-handed and right-handed individuals, as well as virtual robots, in spatial tasks.

Dr. Cheng’s research agenda spans diverse scientific questions across spatial and temporal scales. She investigates how neuroinflammation in the medial temporal lobe contributes to spatial disorientation and examines sex differences in spatial abilities across different cultural and geographical contexts. Additionally, her work considers evolutionary perspectives on navigation strategies, such as the hunter-gatherer theory.
