Dr. Cole Korponay’s research program in human neuroimaging and behavior emerges from a fusion of diverse training backgrounds. As a post-doctoral research fellow, via a F32-funded neuroanatomy-neuroimaging collaboration with Dr. Suzanne Haber and NIDA, he leveraged “ground-truth” anatomy data to sculpt fMRI analysis methods that yield new perspectives on brain organization and disease.

As a graduate student, Dr. Korponay’s joint training in neuroscience and public policy cultivated perspective on how his research on the neural basis of impulsive decision making could inform broader societal issues, such as the aptness of legal definitions of culpability and insanity. Collectively, the goal of Dr. Korponay’s research is to advance analytic tools for understanding the brain and to leverage the knowledge gained to help treat neuropsychiatric illness and inform public policy.
