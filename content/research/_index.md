title: Advancing Neuroimaging Science
subtitle: |
  The Applied Neuroimaging Statistics Research Laboratory is an academic research group dedicated to improving statistical methodologies for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our research spans multiple domains, including the development of novel computational tools for studying the brain's structural and functional connectome. We leverage state-of-the-art techniques such as multi-modal data fusion and machine learning to address fundamental questions in neuroimaging and to enhance our understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders. 
  
  Our work bridges theory and application, combining methodological innovation with empirical investigations in neuroimaging. By integrating advanced statistical approaches with neurobiological data, we aim to refine how we study brain networks, mental illness, and cognitive function.

        - Utilize large-scale, open-access neuroimaging datasets to apply **NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework** for understanding neuropsychiatric conditions as variations along a normal-to-pathological continuum.
        - Map neurocircuitry associated with cognitive and emotional systems and study how deviations from normative models contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms across aging and disease populations.

        - Investigate how neurocircuitry degeneration in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) relates to neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as depression, anxiety, agitation, and apathy.
        - Utilize the **Triple Network Model** (Default Mode Network, Central Executive Network, Salience Network) to examine mechanisms underlying NPS in AD.
        - Leverage large-scale datasets (HCP, ADNI, CRHD) to build normative models of brain-behavior relationships and identify deviations that contribute to disease pathology.
