abstract: Focusing on sex differences is necessary to fully understand basic neurobiological
  processes such as the engagement of large-scale brain networks  involved in attention.
  Prior work suggests that women show enhanced attention  during tasks of reward/punishment
  relative to men. Yet, sex differences in the  engagement of neural networks sub
  serving internal and external focus has been  unexplored in regard to reward and
  punishment. Using data from a large sample (n  = 190) of healthy participants from
  the Human Connectome Project, we investigated  sex differences in default mode network
  (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN),  and frontal parietal network (FPN) activation
  during exposure to reward and  punishment. To determine if sex differences are specific
  to valenced stimuli, we  analyzed network activation during working memory. Results
  indicate that,  relative to men, women have increased suppression of the DMN and
  greater  activation of the DAN during exposure to reward and punishment. Given the  relative
  roles of these networks in internal (DMN) and external (DAN) attention,  this pattern
  of activation suggests that women have enhanced external attention  to reward and
  punishment. In contrast, there were no sex differences in network  activation during
  working memory, indicating that this sex difference is specific  to the processing
  of reward and punishment. These findings suggest a  neurobiological explanation
  for prior work showing women have greater sensitivity  to reward/punishment and
  are more prone to psychiatric disorders characterized by  enhanced attention to
  such stimuli. Furthermore, given the large sample from the  Human Connectome Project,
  the current findings provide general implications for  the study of sex as a biological
  variable in investigation of reward processes.
