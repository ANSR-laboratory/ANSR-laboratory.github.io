abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Identifying data-driven subtypes of major depressive disorder
  (MDD) holds promise for parsing the heterogeneity of MDD in a neurobiologically  informed
  way. However, limited studies have used brain structural covariance  networks (SCNs)
  for subtyping MDD. METHODS: This study included 145 unmedicated  patients with MDD
  and 206 demographically matched healthy control subjects, who  underwent a structural
  magnetic resonance imaging scan and a comprehensive  neurocognitive battery. Patterns
  of structural covariance were identified using  source-based morphometry across
  both patients with MDD and healthy control  subjects. K-means clustering algorithms
  were applied on dysregulated structural  networks in MDD to identify potential MDD
  subtypes. Finally, clinical and  neurocognitive measures were compared between identified
  subgroups to elucidate  the profile of these MDD subtypes. RESULTS: Source-based
  morphometry across all  individuals identified 28 whole-brain SCNs that encompassed
  the prefrontal,  anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices; basal ganglia;
  and cerebellar,  visual, and motor regions. Compared with healthy control subjects,
  individuals  with MDD showed lower structural network integrity in three networks
  including  default mode, ventromedial prefrontal cortical, and salience networks.
  Clustering  analysis revealed two MDD subtypes based on the patterns of structural
  network  abnormalities in these three networks. Further profiling revealed that
  patients  in subtype 1 had younger age of onset and more symptom severity as well
  as  greater deficits in cognitive performance than patients in subtypeÂ 2.  CONCLUSIONS:
  Overall, we identified two MDD subtypes based on SCNs that differed  in their clinical
  and cognitive profile. Our results represent a proof-of-concept  framework for leveraging
  these large-scale SCNs to parse heterogeneity in MDD.'
