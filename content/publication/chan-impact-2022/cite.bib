 abstract = {The Triple Network Model of psychopathology identifies the salience network (SN), central executive network (CEN), and default mode network (DMN) as key networks  underlying the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. In particular, abnormal  SN-initiated network switching impacts the engagement and disengagement of the  CEN and DMN, and is proposed to lead to the generation of psychosis symptoms.  Between-network connectivity has been shown to be abnormal in both substance use  disorders (SUD) and psychosis. However, none have studied how SUD affects  connectivity between sub-networks of the DMN, SN, and CEN in early stage  psychosis (ESP) patients. In this study, we collected data from 113 ESP patients  and 50 healthy controls to investigate the effect of SUD on between-network  connectivity. In addition, we performed sub-group analysis by exploring whether  past SUD vs current SUD co-morbidity, or diagnosis (affective vs non-affective  psychosis) had a modulatory effect. Connectivity between four network-pairs,  consisting of sub-networks of the SN, CEN, and DMN, was significantly different  between ESP patients and controls. Two patterns of connectivity were observed  when patients were divided into sub-groups with current vs past SUD. In  particular, connectivity between right CEN and the cingulo-opercular salience  sub-network (rCEN-CON) showed a gradient effect where the severity of  abnormalities increased from no history of SUD to past+ to current+. We also  observed diagnosis-specific effects, suggesting non-affective psychosis patients  were particularly vulnerable to effects of substance use on rCEN-CON  connectivity. Our findings reveal insights into how comorbid SUD affects  between-network connectivity and symptom severity in ESP.},
