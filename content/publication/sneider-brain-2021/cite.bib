 abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disorder that interferes with daily functioning, and that occurs at higher rates in women than in men.  Structural and functional alterations in hippocampus and frontal lobe have been  reported in MDD, which likely contribute to the multifaceted nature of MDD. One  area impacted by MDD is hippocampal-mediated memory, which can be probed using a  spatial virtual Morris water task (MWT). Women (n=24) across a spectrum of  depression severity underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during  MWT. Depression severity, assessed via Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), was  examined relative to brain activation during task performance. Significant brain  activation was evident in areas traditionally implicated in spatial memory  processing, including right hippocampus and frontal lobe regions, for retrieval \textgreater  motor contrast. When BDI was included as a regressor, significantly less  functional activation was evident in left hippocampus, and other non-frontal,  task relevant regions for retrieval \textgreater rest contrast. Consistent with previous  studies, depression severity was associated with functional alterations observed  during spatial memory performance. These findings may contribute to understanding  neurobiological underpinnings of depression severity and associated memory  impairments, which may have implications for treatment approaches aimed at  alleviating effects of depression in women.},
