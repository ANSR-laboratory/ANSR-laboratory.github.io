abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disorder that interferes
  with daily functioning, and that occurs at higher rates in women than in men.  Structural
  and functional alterations in hippocampus and frontal lobe have been  reported in
  MDD, which likely contribute to the multifaceted nature of MDD. One  area impacted
  by MDD is hippocampal-mediated memory, which can be probed using a  spatial virtual
  Morris water task (MWT). Women (n=24) across a spectrum of  depression severity
  underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during  MWT. Depression severity,
  assessed via Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), was  examined relative to brain activation
  during task performance. Significant brain  activation was evident in areas traditionally
  implicated in spatial memory  processing, including right hippocampus and frontal
  lobe regions, for retrieval textgreater  motor contrast. When BDI was included as
  a regressor, significantly less  functional activation was evident in left hippocampus,
  and other non-frontal,  task relevant regions for retrieval textgreater rest contrast.
  Consistent with previous  studies, depression severity was associated with functional
  alterations observed  during spatial memory performance. These findings may contribute
  to understanding  neurobiological underpinnings of depression severity and associated
  memory  impairments, which may have implications for treatment approaches aimed
  at  alleviating effects of depression in women.
