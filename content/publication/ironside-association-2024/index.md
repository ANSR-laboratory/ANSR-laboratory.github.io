abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Preclinical work suggests that excess glucocorticoids and reduced
  cortical γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may affect sex-dependent differences in brain  regions
  implicated in stress regulation and depressive phenotypes. The authors  sought to
  address a critical gap in knowledge, namely, how stress circuitry is  functionally
  affected by glucocorticoids and GABA in current or remitted major  depressive disorder
  (MDD). METHODS: Multimodal imaging data were collected from  130 young adults (ages
  18-25), of whom 44 had current MDD, 42 had remitted MDD,  and 44 were healthy comparison
  subjects. GABA+ (γ-aminobutyric acid and  macromolecules) was assessed using magnetic
  resonance spectroscopy, and  task-related functional MRI data were collected under
  acute stress and analyzed  using data-driven network modeling. RESULTS: Across modalities,
  trait-related  abnormalities emerged. Relative to healthy comparison subjects, both
  clinical  groups were characterized by lower rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)
  GABA+  and frontoparietal network amplitude but higher amplitude in salience and  stress-related
  networks. For the remitted MDD group, differences from the healthy  comparison group
  emerged in the context of elevated cortisol levels, whereas the  MDD group had lower
  cortisol levels than the healthy comparison group. In the  comparison group, frontoparietal
  and stress-related network connectivity was  positively associated with cortisol
  level (highlighting putative top-down  regulation of stress), but the opposite relationship
  emerged in the MDD and  remitted MDD groups. Finally, rACC GABA+ was associated
  with stress-induced  changes in connectivity between overlapping default mode and
  salience networks.  CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime MDD was characterized by reduced rACC
  GABA+ as well as  dysregulated cortisol-related interactions between top-down control  (frontoparietal)
  and threat (task-related) networks. These findings warrant  further investigation
  of the role of GABA in the vulnerability to and treatment  of MDD.'
