abstract: Networks of brain regions having synchronized fluctuations of the blood
  oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) time-series
  at  rest, or \"resting state networks\" (RSNs), are emerging as a basis for  understanding
  intrinsic brain activity. RSNs are topographically consistent with  activity-related
  networks subserving sensory, motor, and cognitive processes, and  studying their
  spontaneous fluctuations following acute drug challenge may  provide a way to understand
  better the neuroanatomical substrates of drug action.  The present within-subject
  double-blind study used BOLD fMRI at 3T to investigate  the functional networks
  influenced by the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem  (Ambien). Zolpidem is a
  positive modulator of Î³-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A))  receptors, and engenders
  sedative effects that may be explained in part by how it  modulates intrinsic brain
  activity. Healthy participants (n=12) underwent fMRI  scanning 45 min after acute
  oral administration of zolpidem (0, 5, 10, or 20mg),  and changes in BOLD signal
  were measured while participants gazed at a static  fixation point (i.e., at rest).
  Data were analyzed using group independent  component analysis (ICA) with dual regression
  and results indicated that compared  to placebo, the highest dose of zolpidem increased
  functional connectivity within  a number of sensory, motor, and limbic networks.
  These results are consistent  with previous studies showing an increase in functional
  connectivity at rest  following administration of the positive GABA(A) receptor
  modulators midazolam  and alcohol, and suggest that investigating how zolpidem modulates
  intrinsic  brain activity may have implications for understanding the etiology of
  its  powerful sedative effects.
