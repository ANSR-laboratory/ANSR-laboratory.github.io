 abstract = {Networks of brain regions having synchronized fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) time-series at  rest, or "resting state networks" (RSNs), are emerging as a basis for  understanding intrinsic brain activity. RSNs are topographically consistent with  activity-related networks subserving sensory, motor, and cognitive processes, and  studying their spontaneous fluctuations following acute drug challenge may  provide a way to understand better the neuroanatomical substrates of drug action.  The present within-subject double-blind study used BOLD fMRI at 3T to investigate  the functional networks influenced by the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem  (Ambien). Zolpidem is a positive modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A))  receptors, and engenders sedative effects that may be explained in part by how it  modulates intrinsic brain activity. Healthy participants (n=12) underwent fMRI  scanning 45 min after acute oral administration of zolpidem (0, 5, 10, or 20mg),  and changes in BOLD signal were measured while participants gazed at a static  fixation point (i.e., at rest). Data were analyzed using group independent  component analysis (ICA) with dual regression and results indicated that compared  to placebo, the highest dose of zolpidem increased functional connectivity within  a number of sensory, motor, and limbic networks. These results are consistent  with previous studies showing an increase in functional connectivity at rest  following administration of the positive GABA(A) receptor modulators midazolam  and alcohol, and suggest that investigating how zolpidem modulates intrinsic  brain activity may have implications for understanding the etiology of its  powerful sedative effects.},
