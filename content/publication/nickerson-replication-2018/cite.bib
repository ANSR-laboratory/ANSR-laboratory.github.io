 abstract = {There have been many recent reports highlighting a crisis in replication and reliability of research in psychology, neuroscience, and neuroimaging. After a  series of reports uncovered various methodological problems with functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research, considerable attention has been given  to principles and practices to improve reproducibility of neuroimaging findings,  including promotion of openness, transparency, and data sharing. However, much  less attention has been given to use of open access neuroimaging datasets to  conduct replication studies. A major barrier to reproducing neuroimaging studies  is their high cost, in money and labor, and utilizing such datasets is an obvious  solution for breaking down this barrier. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is an  open access dataset consisting of extensive neurological, behavioral, and  genetics assessments and neuroimaging data from over 1,100 individuals. In the  present study, findings supporting the replication of a highly cited neuroimaging  study that showed correspondence between resting state and task brain networks,  and novel findings on activation of brain networks during task performance that  arose with this exercise are presented as a demonstration of use of the HCP for  replication studies.},
