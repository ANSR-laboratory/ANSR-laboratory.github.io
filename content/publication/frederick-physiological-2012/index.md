abstract: Confounding noise in BOLD fMRI data arises primarily from fluctuations in
  blood flow and oxygenation due to cardiac and respiratory effects, spontaneous low  frequency
  oscillations (LFO) in arterial pressure, and non-task related neural  activity.
  Cardiac noise is particularly problematic, as the low sampling  frequency of BOLD
  fMRI ensures that these effects are aliased in recorded data.  Various methods have
  been proposed to estimate the noise signal through  measurement and transformation
  of the cardiac and respiratory waveforms (e.g.  RETROICOR and respiration volume
  per time (RVT)) and model-free estimation of  noise variance through examination
  of spatial and temporal patterns. We have  previously demonstrated that by applying
  a voxel-specific time delay to  concurrently acquired near infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) data, we can generate  regressors that reflect systemic blood flow and oxygenation
  fluctuations effects.  Here, we apply this method to the task of removing physiological
  noise from BOLD  data. We compare the efficacy of noise removal using various sets
  of noise  regressors generated from NIRS data, and also compare the noise removal
  to  RETROICOR+RVT. We compare the results of resting state analyses using the  original
  and noise filtered data, and we evaluate the bias for the different  noise filtration
  methods by computing null distributions from the resting data  and comparing them
  with the expected theoretical distributions. Using the best  set of processing choices,
  six NIRS-generated regressors with voxel-specific time  delays explain a median
  of 10.5% of the variance throughout the brain, with the  highest reductions being
  seen in gray matter. By comparison, the nine  RETROICOR+RVT regressors together
  explain a median of 6.8% of the variance in the  BOLD data. Detection of resting
  state networks was enhanced with NIRS denoising,  and there were no appreciable
  differences in the bias of the different  techniques. Physiological noise regressors
  generated using Regressor  Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offer
  an effective method for  efficiently removing hemodynamic noise from BOLD data.
