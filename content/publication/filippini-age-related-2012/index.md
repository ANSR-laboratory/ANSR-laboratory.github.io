abstract: Several studies have demonstrated age-related regional differences in the
  magnitude of the BOLD signal using task-based fMRI. It has been suggested that  functional
  changes reflect either compensatory or de-differentiation mechanisms,  both of which
  assume response to a specific stimulus. Here, we have tested  whether ageing affects
  both task-based and resting brain function, and the extent  to which functional
  changes are mediated by reductions in grey matter (GM)  volume. Two groups, of 22
  healthy younger and 22 older volunteers, underwent an  imaging protocol involving
  structural and functional MRI, both during a memory  task and at rest. The two groups
  had similar socio-demographical characteristics  and cognitive performance. Image
  analysis revealed both structural and functional  differences. Increased BOLD signal
  in older relative to younger volunteers was  mainly observed in the frontal lobes,
  both during the task and at rest.  Functional changes in the frontal lobes were
  largely located in brain regions  spared from GM loss, and adding GM covariates
  to the fMRI analysis did not  significantly alter the group differences. Our results
  are consistent with the  suggestion that, during normal ageing, the brain responds
  to neuronal loss by  fine-tuning connections between spared neurons. Longitudinal
  studies will be  necessary to fully test this hypothesis.
