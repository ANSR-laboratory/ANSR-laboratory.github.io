abstract: Menstrual pain is associated with deficits in central pain processing, yet
  neuroimaging studies to date have all been limited by focusing on group  comparisons
  of adult women with vs without menstrual pain. This study aimed to  investigate
  the role of the triple network model (TNM) of brain networks in  adolescent girls
  with varied menstrual pain severity ratings. One hundred  participants (ages 13-19
  years) completed a 6-min resting state functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  scan and rated menstrual pain severity,  menstrual pain interference, and cumulative
  menstrual pain exposure. Imaging  analyses included age and gynecological age (years
  since menarche) as covariates.  Menstrual pain severity was positively associated
  with functional connectivity  between the cingulo-opercular salience network (cSN)
  and the sensory processing  regions, limbic regions, and insula, and was also positively
  associated with  connectivity between the left central executive network (CEN) and
  posterior  regions. Menstrual pain interference was positively associated with connectivity  between
  the cSN and widespread brain areas. In addition, menstrual pain  interference was
  positively associated with connectivity within the left CEN,  whereas connectivity
  both within the right CEN and between the right CEN and  cortical areas outside
  the network (including the insula) were negatively  associated with menstrual pain
  interference. Cumulative menstrual pain exposure  shared a strong negative association
  with connectivity between the default mode  network and other widespread regions
  associated with large-scale brain networks.  These findings support a key role for
  the involvement of TNM brain networks in  menstrual pain characteristics and suggest
  that alterations in pain processing  exist in adolescents with varying levels of
  menstrual pain.
