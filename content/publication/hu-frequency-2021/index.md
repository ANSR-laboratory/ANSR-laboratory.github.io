abstract: "BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has
  been made based on symptoms. Extensive studies have demonstrated that PD may lead
  to  variation of brain activity in different frequency bands. However, frequency\
  \  specific dynamic alterations of PD have not yet been explored. NEW METHOD: In\
  \  order to address this gap, a novel sparse nonnegative tensor decomposition (SNTD)\
  \  method was used to estimate frequency specific co-activation patterns (CAP).
  The  difference between PD and healthy controls (HC) are investigated with the \
  \ proposed framework. RESULT: The difference between PD and HC mainly exists at\
  \  frequency band 0.04-0.1Â Hz in basal ganglia. We also found that the average \
  \ intensity of PD in this frequency band is significantly correlated with the Hoehn\
  \  and Yahr scale. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Compared with conventional
  CAP  approach, SNTD estimates frequency specific CAPs that show alterations in PD\
  \  patients. CONCLUSION: SNTD provides an alternative to K-means clustering used
  in  conventional CAP analysis. With the proposed framework, frequency specific CAPs\
  \  are extracted, and alterations in PD patients are also successfully discovered."
