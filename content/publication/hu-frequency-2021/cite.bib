 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been made based on symptoms. Extensive studies have demonstrated that PD may lead to  variation of brain activity in different frequency bands. However, frequency  specific dynamic alterations of PD have not yet been explored. NEW METHOD: In  order to address this gap, a novel sparse nonnegative tensor decomposition (SNTD)  method was used to estimate frequency specific co-activation patterns (CAP). The  difference between PD and healthy controls (HC) are investigated with the  proposed framework. RESULT: The difference between PD and HC mainly exists at  frequency band 0.04-0.1 Hz in basal ganglia. We also found that the average  intensity of PD in this frequency band is significantly correlated with the Hoehn  and Yahr scale. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Compared with conventional CAP  approach, SNTD estimates frequency specific CAPs that show alterations in PD  patients. CONCLUSION: SNTD provides an alternative to K-means clustering used in  conventional CAP analysis. With the proposed framework, frequency specific CAPs  are extracted, and alterations in PD patients are also successfully discovered.},
