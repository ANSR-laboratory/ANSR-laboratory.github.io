abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Family caregivers of patients with dementia suffer a high
  burden of depression and reduced positive emotions. Mentalizing imagery therapy
  (MIT)  provides mindfulness and guided imagery skills training to improve balanced  mentalizing
  and emotion regulation. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to test the  hypotheses that MIT
  for family caregivers would reduce depression symptoms and  improve positive psychological
  traits more than a support group (SG), and would  increase dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex (DLPFC) connectivity and reduce subgenual  anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC)
  connectivity. METHODS: Forty-six caregivers  participated in a randomized controlled
  trial comparing a 4-week MIT group (n =  24) versus an SG (n = 22). Resting state
  neuroimaging was obtained at baseline  and post-group in 28 caregivers, and questionnaires
  completed by all  participants. The primary outcome was change in depression; secondary
  measures  included anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. Brain
  networks  with participation of DLPFC and sgACC were identified. Connectivity strengths
  of  DLPFC and sgACC with respective networks were determined with dual regression.  DLPFC
  connectivity was correlated with mindfulness and depression outcomes.  RESULTS:
  MIT significantly outperformed SG in improving depression, anxiety,  mindfulness,
  self-compassion, and well-being, with moderate to large effect  sizes. Relative
  to SG, participants in MIT showed significant increases in DLPFC  connectivity -
  exactly replicating pilot study results - but no change in sgACC.  DLPFC connectivity
  change correlated positively with mindfulness and negatively  with depression change.
  CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, MIT was superior to SG for  reducing depression and
  anxiety symptoms and improving positive psychological  traits. Neuroimaging results
  suggested that strengthening DLPFC connectivity with  an emotion regulation network
  might be mechanistically related to MIT effects.'
