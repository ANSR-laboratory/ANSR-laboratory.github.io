abstract: The inequitable distribution of economic resources and exposure to adversity
  between racial groups contributes to mental health disparities within the United  States.
  Consideration of the potential neurodevelopmental consequences, however,  has been
  limited particularly for neurocircuitry known to regulate the emotional  response
  to threat. Characterizing the consequences of inequity on threat  neurocircuitry
  is critical for robust and generalizable neurobiological models of  psychiatric
  illness. Here we use data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive  Development Study
  4.0 release to investigate the contributions of individual and  neighborhood-level
  economic resources and exposure to discrimination. We  investigate the potential
  appearance of race-related differences using both  standard methods and through
  population-level normative modeling. We show that,  in a sample of white and Black
  adolescents, racial inequities in socioeconomic  factors largely contribute to the
  appearance of race-related differences in  cortical thickness of threat neurocircuitry.
  The race-related differences are  preserved through the use of population-level
  models and such models also  preserve associations between cortical thickness and
  specific socioeconomic  factors. The present findings highlight that such socioeconomic
  inequities  largely underlie race-related differences in brain morphology. The present  findings
  provide important new insight for the generation of generalizable  neurobiological
  models of psychiatric illness.
