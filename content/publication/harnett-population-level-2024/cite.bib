 abstract = {The inequitable distribution of economic resources and exposure to adversity between racial groups contributes to mental health disparities within the United  States. Consideration of the potential neurodevelopmental consequences, however,  has been limited particularly for neurocircuitry known to regulate the emotional  response to threat. Characterizing the consequences of inequity on threat  neurocircuitry is critical for robust and generalizable neurobiological models of  psychiatric illness. Here we use data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive  Development Study 4.0 release to investigate the contributions of individual and  neighborhood-level economic resources and exposure to discrimination. We  investigate the potential appearance of race-related differences using both  standard methods and through population-level normative modeling. We show that,  in a sample of white and Black adolescents, racial inequities in socioeconomic  factors largely contribute to the appearance of race-related differences in  cortical thickness of threat neurocircuitry. The race-related differences are  preserved through the use of population-level models and such models also  preserve associations between cortical thickness and specific socioeconomic  factors. The present findings highlight that such socioeconomic inequities  largely underlie race-related differences in brain morphology. The present  findings provide important new insight for the generation of generalizable  neurobiological models of psychiatric illness.},
