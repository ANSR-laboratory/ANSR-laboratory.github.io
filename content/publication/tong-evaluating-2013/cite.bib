 abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is widely used in resting state functional connectivity studies. ICA is a data-driven method, which uses no a priori  anatomical or functional assumptions. However, as a result, it still relies on  the user to distinguish the independent components (ICs) corresponding to  neuronal activation, peripherally originating signals (without directly  attributable neuronal origin, such as respiration, cardiac pulsation and Mayer  wave), and acquisition artifacts. In this concurrent near infrared spectroscopy  (NIRS)/functional MRI (fMRI) resting state study, we developed a method to  systematically and quantitatively identify the ICs that show strong contributions  from signals originating in the periphery. We applied group ICA (MELODIC from  FSL) to the resting state data of 10 healthy participants. The systemic low  frequency oscillation (LFO) detected simultaneously at each participant's  fingertip by NIRS was used as a regressor to correlate with every  subject-specific IC time course. The ICs that had high correlation with the  systemic LFO were those closely associated with previously described  sensorimotor, visual, and auditory networks. The ICs associated with the default  mode and frontoparietal networks were less affected by the peripheral signals.  The consistency and reproducibility of the results were evaluated using  bootstrapping. This result demonstrates that systemic, low frequency oscillations  in hemodynamic properties overlay the time courses of many spatial patterns  identified in ICA analyses, which complicates the detection and interpretation of  connectivity in these regions of the brain.},
