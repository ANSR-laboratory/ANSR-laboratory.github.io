 abstract = {Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by increased stress sensitivity. Emerging findings in healthy adults suggest that stress responses within  limbic/striatal-prefrontal regions are moderated by sex and unfold over time.  Thus, we hypothesized that stress response abnormalities in MDD might be affected  by sex and stress exposure time. The Montreal Imaging Stress Task was  administered to 124 unmedicated patients with first-episode MDD (76 females) and  243 healthy controls (HC; 137 females) during functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI). Based on prior studies, amygdala, hippocampus, medial  orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex (dlPFC) were selected as a priori regions of interest. In a complementary  approach, we probed the effects of stress on the frontoparietal network (FPN) and  a network including the amygdala, NAc and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Across  groups, males exhibited higher dlPFC activity and right FPN amplitude than  females. Relative to female HCs, the female MDD group had less deactivation in  limbic/striatal regions (amygdala, NAc, hippocampus, Amygdala-NAc-ACC network).  Furthermore, unlike female HCs, the female MDD group failed to show a significant  increase of deactivation over stress exposure time in the amygdala, mOFC and NAc.  Our findings confirm the importance of considering sex differences when  investigating neural stress responses. Case-control differences in neural stress  responses observed in females (but not males) provide insights into sex  differences in the etiology and pathophysiology of depression. The failure to  deactivate limbic/NAc regions in depressed females point to dysfunction of  adaptive stress responses over stress exposure time.},
