 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) are characterized by maladaptive responses to both positive and negative outcomes, which have been  linked to localized abnormal activations in cortical and striatal brain regions.  However, the exact neural circuitry implicated in such abnormalities remains  largely unexplored. METHOD: In this study 26 unmedicated adults with MDD and 29  matched healthy controls (HCs) completed a monetary incentive delay task during  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Psychophysiological interaction  (PPI) analyses probed group differences in connectivity separately in response to  positive and negative outcomes (i.e. monetary gains and penalties). RESULTS:  Relative to HCs, MDD subjects displayed decreased connectivity between the  caudate and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in response to monetary  gains, yet increased connectivity between the caudate and a different, more  rostral, dACC subregion in response to monetary penalties. Moreover, exploratory  analyses of 14 MDD patients who completed a 12-week, double-blind,  placebo-controlled clinical trial after the baseline fMRI scans indicated that a  more normative pattern of cortico-striatal connectivity pre-treatment was  associated with greater improvement in symptoms 12 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS:  These results identify the caudate as a region with dissociable  incentive-dependent dACC connectivity abnormalities in MDD, and provide initial  evidence that cortico-striatal circuitry may play a role in MDD treatment  response. Given the role of cortico-striatal circuitry in encoding action-outcome  contingencies, such dysregulated connectivity may relate to the prominent  disruptions in goal-directed behavior that characterize MDD.},
