 abstract = {Progress in scientific disciplines is accompanied by standardization of terminology. Network neuroscience, at the level of macroscale organization of the  brain, is beginning to confront the challenges associated with developing a  taxonomy of its fundamental explanatory constructs. The Workgroup for HArmonized  Taxonomy of NETworks (WHATNET) was formed in 2020 as an Organization for Human  Brain Mapping (OHBM)-endorsed best practices committee to provide recommendations  on points of consensus, identify open questions, and highlight areas of ongoing  debate in the service of moving the field toward standardized reporting of  network neuroscience results. The committee conducted a survey to catalog current  practices in large-scale brain network nomenclature. A few well-known network  names (e.g., default mode network) dominated responses to the survey, and a  number of illuminating points of disagreement emerged. We summarize survey  results and provide initial considerations and recommendations from the  workgroup. This perspective piece includes a selective review of challenges to  this enterprise, including (1) network scale, resolution, and hierarchies; (2)  interindividual variability of networks; (3) dynamics and nonstationarity of  networks; (4) consideration of network affiliations of subcortical structures;  and (5) consideration of multimodal information. We close with minimal reporting  guidelines for the cognitive and network neuroscience communities to adopt.},
