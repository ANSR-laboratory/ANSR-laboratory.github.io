abstract: Progress in scientific disciplines is accompanied by standardization of
  terminology. Network neuroscience, at the level of macroscale organization of the  brain,
  is beginning to confront the challenges associated with developing a  taxonomy of
  its fundamental explanatory constructs. The Workgroup for HArmonized  Taxonomy of
  NETworks (WHATNET) was formed in 2020 as an Organization for Human  Brain Mapping
  (OHBM)-endorsed best practices committee to provide recommendations  on points of
  consensus, identify open questions, and highlight areas of ongoing  debate in the
  service of moving the field toward standardized reporting of  network neuroscience
  results. The committee conducted a survey to catalog current  practices in large-scale
  brain network nomenclature. A few well-known network  names (e.g., default mode
  network) dominated responses to the survey, and a  number of illuminating points
  of disagreement emerged. We summarize survey  results and provide initial considerations
  and recommendations from the  workgroup. This perspective piece includes a selective
  review of challenges to  this enterprise, including (1) network scale, resolution,
  and hierarchies; (2)  interindividual variability of networks; (3) dynamics and
  nonstationarity of  networks; (4) consideration of network affiliations of subcortical
  structures;  and (5) consideration of multimodal information. We close with minimal
  reporting  guidelines for the cognitive and network neuroscience communities to
  adopt.
