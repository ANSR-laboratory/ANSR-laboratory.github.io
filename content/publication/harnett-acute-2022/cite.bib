 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although aspects of brain morphology have been associated with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), limited work has investigated  multimodal patterns in brain morphology that are linked to acute posttraumatic  stress severity. In the present study, we utilized multimodal magnetic resonance  imaging to investigate if structural covariance networks (SCNs) assessed acutely  following trauma were linked to acute posttraumatic stress severity. METHODS:  Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were collected around 1 month after  civilian trauma exposure in 78 participants. Multimodal magnetic resonance  imaging data fusion was completed to identify combinations of SCNs, termed  structural covariance profiles (SCPs), related to acute posttraumatic stress  severity collected at 1 month. Analyses assessed the relationship between  participant SCP loadings, acute posttraumatic stress severity, the change in  posttraumatic stress severity from 1 to 12 months, and depressive symptoms.  RESULTS: We identified an SCP that reflected greater gray matter properties of  the anterior temporal lobe, fusiform face area, and visual cortex (i.e., the  ventral visual stream) that varied curvilinearly with acute posttraumatic stress  severity and the change in PTSD symptom severity from 1 to 12 months. The SCP was  not associated with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We identified combinations  of multimodal SCNs that are related to variability in PTSD symptoms in the early  aftermath of trauma. The identified SCNs may reflect patterns of neuroanatomical  organization that provide unique insight into acute posttraumatic stress.  Furthermore, these multimodal SCNs may be potential candidates for neural markers  of susceptibility to both acute posttraumatic stress and the future development  of PTSD.},
