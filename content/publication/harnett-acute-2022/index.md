abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Although aspects of brain morphology have been associated with
  chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), limited work has investigated  multimodal
  patterns in brain morphology that are linked to acute posttraumatic  stress severity.
  In the present study, we utilized multimodal magnetic resonance  imaging to investigate
  if structural covariance networks (SCNs) assessed acutely  following trauma were
  linked to acute posttraumatic stress severity. METHODS:  Structural magnetic resonance
  imaging data were collected around 1 month after  civilian trauma exposure in 78
  participants. Multimodal magnetic resonance  imaging data fusion was completed to
  identify combinations of SCNs, termed  structural covariance profiles (SCPs), related
  to acute posttraumatic stress  severity collected at 1 month. Analyses assessed
  the relationship between  participant SCP loadings, acute posttraumatic stress severity,
  the change in  posttraumatic stress severity from 1 to 12 months, and depressive
  symptoms.  RESULTS: We identified an SCP that reflected greater gray matter properties
  of  the anterior temporal lobe, fusiform face area, and visual cortex (i.e., the  ventral
  visual stream) that varied curvilinearly with acute posttraumatic stress  severity
  and the change in PTSD symptom severity from 1 to 12 months. The SCP was  not associated
  with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We identified combinations  of multimodal
  SCNs that are related to variability in PTSD symptoms in the early  aftermath of
  trauma. The identified SCNs may reflect patterns of neuroanatomical  organization
  that provide unique insight into acute posttraumatic stress.  Furthermore, these
  multimodal SCNs may be potential candidates for neural markers  of susceptibility
  to both acute posttraumatic stress and the future development  of PTSD.'
