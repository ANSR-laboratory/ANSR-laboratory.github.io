 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Converging evidence indicates impaired brain energy metabolism in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Creatine kinase (CK) is pivotal in  providing adenosine triphosphate in the cell and maintaining its levels when  energy demand is increased. However, the activity of CK has not been investigated  in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHODS: Using  in vivo phosphorus magnetization transfer spectroscopy, we measured CK  first-order forward rate constant (k (f) ) in the frontal lobe, in patients with  first-episode psychosis (FEP; n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 34), at rest.  RESULTS: CK k (f) was significantly reduced in FEP compared to healthy controls.  There were no differences in other energy metabolism-related measures, including  phosphocreatine (PCr) or ATP, between groups. We also found increase in  glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine, a putative membrane breakdown product, in patients.  CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that brain bioenergetic  abnormalities are already present early in the course of schizophrenia spectrum  disorders. Future research is needed to identify the relationship of reduced CK k  (f) with psychotic symptoms and to test treatment alternatives targeting this  pathway. Increased glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine is consistent with earlier  studies in medication-naïve patients and later studies in first-episode  schizophrenia, and suggest enhanced synaptic pruning.},
