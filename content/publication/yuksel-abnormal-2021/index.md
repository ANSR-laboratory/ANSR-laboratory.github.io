abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Converging evidence indicates impaired brain energy metabolism
  in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Creatine kinase (CK) is pivotal
  in  providing adenosine triphosphate in the cell and maintaining its levels when  energy
  demand is increased. However, the activity of CK has not been investigated  in patients
  with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHODS: Using  in vivo phosphorus
  magnetization transfer spectroscopy, we measured CK  first-order forward rate constant
  (k (f) ) in the frontal lobe, in patients with  first-episode psychosis (FEP; n
  = 16) and healthy controls (n = 34), at rest.  RESULTS: CK k (f) was significantly
  reduced in FEP compared to healthy controls.  There were no differences in other
  energy metabolism-related measures, including  phosphocreatine (PCr) or ATP, between
  groups. We also found increase in  glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine, a putative membrane
  breakdown product, in patients.  CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate
  that brain bioenergetic  abnormalities are already present early in the course of
  schizophrenia spectrum  disorders. Future research is needed to identify the relationship
  of reduced CK k  (f) with psychotic symptoms and to test treatment alternatives
  targeting this  pathway. Increased glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine is consistent with
  earlier  studies in medication-naïve patients and later studies in first-episode  schizophrenia,
  and suggest enhanced synaptic pruning.'
