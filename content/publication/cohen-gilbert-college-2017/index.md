abstract: The transition to college is associated with an increase in heavy episodic
  alcohol use, or binge drinking, during a time when the prefrontal cortex and  prefrontal-limbic
  circuitry continue to mature. Traits associated with this  immaturity, including
  impulsivity in emotional contexts, may contribute to risky  and heavy episodic alcohol
  consumption. The current study used blood oxygen level  dependent (BOLD) multiband
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess  brain activation during
  a task that required participants to ignore background  images with positive, negative,
  or neutral emotional valence while performing an  inhibitory control task (Go-NoGo).
  Subjects were 23 college freshmen (seven male,  18-20 years) who engaged in a range
  of drinking behavior (past 3 months' binge  episodes range = 0-19, mean = 4.6, total
  drinks consumed range = 0-104, mean =  32.0). Brain activation on inhibitory trials
  (NoGo) was contrasted between  negative and neutral conditions and between positive
  and neutral conditions using  non-parametric testing (5000 permutations) and cluster-based
  thresholding (z =  2.3), p â‰¤ 0.05 corrected. Results showed that a higher recent
  incidence of binge  drinking was significantly associated with decreased activation
  of dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC),
  and anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC), brain regions strongly implicated in executive  functioning,
  during negative relative to neutral inhibitory trials. No  significant associations
  between binge drinking and brain activation were  observed for positive relative
  to neutral images. While task performance was not  significantly associated with
  binge drinking in this sample, subjects with  heavier recent binge drinking showed
  decreased recruitment of executive control  regions under negative versus neutral
  distractor conditions. These findings  suggest that in young adults with heavier
  recent binge drinking, processing of  negative emotional images interferes more
  with inhibitory control neurocircuitry  than in young adults who do not binge drink
  often. This pattern of altered  frontal lobe activation associated with binge drinking
  may serve as an early  marker of risk for future self-regulation deficits that could
  lead to problematic  alcohol use. These findings underscore the importance of understanding
  the impact  of emotion on cognitive control and associated brain functioning in
  binge  drinking behaviors among young adults.
