 abstract = {Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is one of the most popular techniques for the analysis of resting state FMRI data because it has several advantageous  properties when compared with other techniques. Most notably, in contrast to a  conventional seed-based correlation analysis, it is model-free and multivariate,  thus switching the focus from evaluating the functional connectivity of single  brain regions identified a priori to evaluating brain connectivity in terms of  all brain resting state networks (RSNs) that simultaneously engage in oscillatory  activity. Furthermore, typical seed-based analysis characterizes RSNs in terms of  spatially distributed patterns of correlation (typically by means of simple  Pearson's coefficients) and thereby confounds together amplitude information of  oscillatory activity and noise. ICA and other regression techniques, on the other  hand, retain magnitude information and therefore can be sensitive to both changes  in the spatially distributed nature of correlations (differences in the spatial  pattern or "shape") as well as the amplitude of the network activity.  Furthermore, motion can mimic amplitude effects so it is crucial to use a  technique that retains such information to ensure that connectivity differences  are accurately localized. In this work, we investigate the dual regression  approach that is frequently applied with group ICA to assess group differences in  resting state functional connectivity of brain networks. We show how ignoring  amplitude effects and how excessive motion corrupts connectivity maps and results  in spurious connectivity differences. We also show how to implement the dual  regression to retain amplitude information and how to use dual regression outputs  to identify potential motion effects. Two key findings are that using a technique  that retains magnitude information, e.g., dual regression, and using strict  motion criteria are crucial for controlling both network amplitude and  motion-related amplitude effects, respectively, in resting state connectivity  analyses. We illustrate these concepts using realistic simulated resting state  FMRI data and in vivo data acquired in healthy subjects and patients with bipolar  disorder and schizophrenia.},
