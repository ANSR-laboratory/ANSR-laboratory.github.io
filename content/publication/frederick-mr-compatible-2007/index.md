abstract: 'Smoking is the preferred method of administration for two of the most frequently
  abused drugs, marijuana and nicotine. The high temporal and spatial resolution of  functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) make it a natural choice for  studying the neurobiological
  effects of smoked drugs if the challenges of smoking  in a magnetic resonance (MR)
  scanner can be overcome. We report on a design for  an MR-compatible smoking device
  that can be used for smoking marijuana (or  tobacco) during fMRI examinations. Nine
  volunteers smoked marijuana cigarettes  (3.51% Delta9-THC) on two occasions: with
  and without the device. The device  allowed subjects to smoke while they lay in
  the scanner, while containing all  smoke and odors. Plasma Delta9-THC, subjective
  reports of intoxication, and heart  rate increases are reported, and were all similar
  in individuals smoking  marijuana either with or without the device. The use of
  this device will help  advance research studies on smoked drugs including marijuana,
  tobacco and crack  cocaine.'
