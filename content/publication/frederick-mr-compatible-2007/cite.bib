 abstract = {Smoking is the preferred method of administration for two of the most frequently abused drugs, marijuana and nicotine. The high temporal and spatial resolution of  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) make it a natural choice for  studying the neurobiological effects of smoked drugs if the challenges of smoking  in a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner can be overcome. We report on a design for  an MR-compatible smoking device that can be used for smoking marijuana (or  tobacco) during fMRI examinations. Nine volunteers smoked marijuana cigarettes  (3.51% Delta9-THC) on two occasions: with and without the device. The device  allowed subjects to smoke while they lay in the scanner, while containing all  smoke and odors. Plasma Delta9-THC, subjective reports of intoxication, and heart  rate increases are reported, and were all similar in individuals smoking  marijuana either with or without the device. The use of this device will help  advance research studies on smoked drugs including marijuana, tobacco and crack  cocaine.},
