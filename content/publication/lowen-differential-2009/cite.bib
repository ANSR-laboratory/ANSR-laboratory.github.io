 abstract = {Many blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown a strong response due to cocaine in brain regions with  high concentrations of dopamine receptors. However, cocaine also has non-specific  effects, including cardiovascular changes that may cause changes in BOLD signals,  raising the possibility that measured changes could be due to these non-specific  effects. The following experiment was conducted to address this concern. Subjects  were given either cocaine or saline infusions during a long BOLD functional  magnetic resonance imaging study. A flashing uniform-field stimulus, periodically  alternating between on and off, provided a strong activation of primary visual  cortex. There was a significant main effect of drug between cocaine and placebo.  Although we did not demonstrate a significant drug x time interaction, BOLD  signal changes associated with visual stimulation appeared unchanged after  cocaine administration, whereas the signal differences appeared to decrease  during placebo. Explanation of the differential response between the two groups  may reflect cocaine expectancy instead of a direct effect of cocaine on BOLD  signal changes but will require further investigation to fully elucidate.},
