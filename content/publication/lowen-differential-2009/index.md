abstract: Many blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance
  imaging studies have shown a strong response due to cocaine in brain regions with  high
  concentrations of dopamine receptors. However, cocaine also has non-specific  effects,
  including cardiovascular changes that may cause changes in BOLD signals,  raising
  the possibility that measured changes could be due to these non-specific  effects.
  The following experiment was conducted to address this concern. Subjects  were given
  either cocaine or saline infusions during a long BOLD functional  magnetic resonance
  imaging study. A flashing uniform-field stimulus, periodically  alternating between
  on and off, provided a strong activation of primary visual  cortex. There was a
  significant main effect of drug between cocaine and placebo.  Although we did not
  demonstrate a significant drug x time interaction, BOLD  signal changes associated
  with visual stimulation appeared unchanged after  cocaine administration, whereas
  the signal differences appeared to decrease  during placebo. Explanation of the
  differential response between the two groups  may reflect cocaine expectancy instead
  of a direct effect of cocaine on BOLD  signal changes but will require further investigation
  to fully elucidate.
