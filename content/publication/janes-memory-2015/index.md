abstract: Nicotine dependence is a chronic and difficult to treat disorder. While
  environmental stimuli associated with smoking precipitate craving and relapse, it  is
  unknown whether smoking cues are cognitively processed differently than  neutral
  stimuli. To evaluate working memory differences between smoking-related  and neutral
  stimuli, we conducted a delay-match-to-sample (DMS) task concurrently  with functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in nicotine-dependent  participants. The DMS task
  evaluates brain activation during the encoding,  maintenance and retrieval phases
  of working memory. Smoking images induced  significantly more subjective craving,
  and greater midline cortical activation  during encoding in comparison to neutral
  stimuli that were similar in content yet  lacked a smoking component. The insula,
  which is involved in maintaining nicotine  dependence, was active during the successful
  retrieval of previously viewed  smoking versus neutral images. In contrast, neutral
  images required more  prefrontal cortex-mediated active maintenance during the maintenance
  period.  These findings indicate that distinct brain regions are involved in the
  different  phases of working memory for smoking-related versus neutral images. Importantly,  the
  results implicate the insula in the retrieval of smoking-related stimuli,  which
  is relevant given the insula's emerging role in addiction.
