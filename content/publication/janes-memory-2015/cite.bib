 abstract = {Nicotine dependence is a chronic and difficult to treat disorder. While environmental stimuli associated with smoking precipitate craving and relapse, it  is unknown whether smoking cues are cognitively processed differently than  neutral stimuli. To evaluate working memory differences between smoking-related  and neutral stimuli, we conducted a delay-match-to-sample (DMS) task concurrently  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in nicotine-dependent  participants. The DMS task evaluates brain activation during the encoding,  maintenance and retrieval phases of working memory. Smoking images induced  significantly more subjective craving, and greater midline cortical activation  during encoding in comparison to neutral stimuli that were similar in content yet  lacked a smoking component. The insula, which is involved in maintaining nicotine  dependence, was active during the successful retrieval of previously viewed  smoking versus neutral images. In contrast, neutral images required more  prefrontal cortex-mediated active maintenance during the maintenance period.  These findings indicate that distinct brain regions are involved in the different  phases of working memory for smoking-related versus neutral images. Importantly,  the results implicate the insula in the retrieval of smoking-related stimuli,  which is relevant given the insula's emerging role in addiction.},
