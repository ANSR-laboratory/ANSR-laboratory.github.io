 abstract = {Pooling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across research studies, or utilizing shared data from imaging repositories, presents exceptional  opportunities to advance and enhance reproducibility of neuroscience research.  However, scanner confounds hinder pooling data collected on different scanners or  across software and hardware upgrades on the same scanner, even when all  acquisition protocols are harmonized. These confounds reduce power and can lead  to spurious findings. Unfortunately, methods to address this problem are scant.  In this study, we propose a novel denoising approach that implements a  data-driven linked independent component analysis (LICA) to identify  scanner-related effects for removal from multimodal MRI to denoise scanner  effects. We utilized multi-study data to test our proposed method that were  collected on a single 3T scanner, pre- and post-software and major hardware  upgrades and using different acquisition parameters. Our proposed denoising  method shows a greater reduction of scanner-related variance compared with  standard GLM confound regression or ICA-based single-modality denoising. Although  we did not test it here, for combining data across different scanners, LICA  should prove even better at identifying scanner effects as between-scanner  variability is generally much larger than within-scanner variability. Our method  has great promise for denoising scanner effects in multi-study and in large-scale  multi-site studies that may be confounded by scanner differences.},
