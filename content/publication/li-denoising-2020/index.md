abstract: Pooling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across research studies, or
  utilizing shared data from imaging repositories, presents exceptional  opportunities
  to advance and enhance reproducibility of neuroscience research.  However, scanner
  confounds hinder pooling data collected on different scanners or  across software
  and hardware upgrades on the same scanner, even when all  acquisition protocols
  are harmonized. These confounds reduce power and can lead  to spurious findings.
  Unfortunately, methods to address this problem are scant.  In this study, we propose
  a novel denoising approach that implements a  data-driven linked independent component
  analysis (LICA) to identify  scanner-related effects for removal from multimodal
  MRI to denoise scanner  effects. We utilized multi-study data to test our proposed
  method that were  collected on a single 3T scanner, pre- and post-software and major
  hardware  upgrades and using different acquisition parameters. Our proposed denoising  method
  shows a greater reduction of scanner-related variance compared with  standard GLM
  confound regression or ICA-based single-modality denoising. Although  we did not
  test it here, for combining data across different scanners, LICA  should prove even
  better at identifying scanner effects as between-scanner  variability is generally
  much larger than within-scanner variability. Our method  has great promise for denoising
  scanner effects in multi-study and in large-scale  multi-site studies that may be
  confounded by scanner differences.
