abstract: Visual components of trauma memories are often vividly re-experienced by
  survivors with deleterious consequences for normal function. Neuroimaging  research
  on trauma has primarily focused on threat-processing circuitry as core  to trauma-related
  dysfunction. Conversely, limited attention has been given to  visual circuitry which
  may be particularly relevant to posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD). Prior work
  suggests that the ventral visual stream is directly  related to the cognitive and
  affective disturbances observed in PTSD and may be  predictive of later symptom
  expression. The present study used multimodal  magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 278)
  collected two weeks after trauma  exposure from the AURORA study, a longitudinal,
  multisite investigation of  adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae. Indices
  of gray and white matter  were combined using data fusion to identify a structural
  covariance network (SCN)  of the ventral visual stream 2 weeks after trauma. Participant's
  loadings on the  SCN were positively associated with both intrusion symptoms and
  intensity of  nightmares. Further, SCN loadings moderated connectivity between a
  previously  observed amygdala-hippocampal functional covariance network and the
  inferior  temporal gyrus. Follow-up MRI data at 6 months showed an inverse relationship  between
  SCN loadings and negative alterations in cognition in mood. Further,  individuals
  who showed decreased strength of the SCN between 2 weeks and 6 months  had generally
  higher PTSD symptom severity over time. The present findings  highlight a role for
  structural integrity of the ventral visual stream in the  development of PTSD. The
  ventral visual stream may be particularly important for  the consolidation or retrieval
  of trauma memories and may contribute to efficient  reactivation of visual components
  of the trauma memory, thereby exacerbating PTSD  symptoms. Potentially chronic engagement
  of the network may lead to reduced  structural integrity which becomes a risk factor
  for lasting PTSD symptoms.
