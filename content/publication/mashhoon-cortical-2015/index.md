abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The prevalence of marijuana (MJ) use among youth and its legalization
  for medical or recreational use has intensified public health endeavors of  understanding
  MJ effects on brain structure and function. Studies indicate that  MJ use is related
  to impaired cognitive performance, and altered functional brain  activation and
  chemistry in adolescents and adults, but MJ effects on brain  morphology in emerging
  adults are less understood. METHODS: Fifteen MJ users (age  21.8±3.6, 2 females)
  and 15 non-user (NU) participants (age 22.3±3.5, 2 females)  were included, demographically
  matched on age, education and alcohol use.  High-resolution structural MR images
  were acquired at 3Tesla. Cortical thickness  (CT) and volumetric analyses were performed
  using Freesurfer. A priori regions of  interest (ROI) included orbitofrontal and
  cingulate cortices, amygdala,  hippocampus and thalamus. RESULTS: Whole brain CT
  analysis did not result in  significant group differences in a priori ROIs but revealed
  MJ users had  significantly less CT (i.e., thinness) in right fusiform gyrus (rFG)
  compared to  NU (ptextless0.05). Thalamic volume was significantly smaller in MJ
  users compared to NU  (right, p=0.05; left, p=0.01) and associated with greater
  non-planning (ptextless0.01)  and overall impulsivity (p=0.04). There were no other
  group differences.  CONCLUSIONS: RFG cortical thinness and smaller thalamic volume
  in emerging adults  is associated with MJ abuse. Furthermore, smaller thalamic volume
  associated with  greater impulsivity contributes to growing evidence that the thalamus
  is  neurobiologically perturbed by MJ use. Collectively, altered thalamic and rFG  structural
  integrity may interfere with their known roles in regulating  visuoperceptual and
  object information processing.'
