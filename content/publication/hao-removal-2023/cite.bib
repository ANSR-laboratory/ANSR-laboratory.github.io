 abstract = {Combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from multi-site studies is a popular approach for constructing larger datasets to greatly enhance the  reliability and reproducibility of neuroscience research. However, the  scanner/site variability is a significant confound that complicates the  interpretation of the results, so effective and complete removal of the  scanner/site variability is necessary to realise the full advantages of pooling  multi-site datasets. Independent component analysis (ICA) and general linear  model (GLM) based harmonisation methods are the two primary methods used to  eliminate scanner/site effects. Unfortunately, there are challenges with both  ICA-based and GLM-based harmonisation methods to remove site effects completely  when the signals of interest and scanner/site effects-related variables are  correlated, which may occur in neuroscience studies. In this study, we propose an  effective and powerful harmonisation strategy that implements dual projection  (DP) theory based on ICA to remove the scanner/site effects more completely. This  method can separate the signal effects correlated with site variables from the  identified site effects for removal without losing signals of interest. Both  simulations and vivo structural MRI datasets, including a dataset from Autism  Brain Imaging Data Exchange II and a travelling subject dataset from the  Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences, were used to test the performance  of a DP-based ICA harmonisation method. Results show that DP-based ICA  harmonisation has superior performance for removing site effects and enhancing  the sensitivity to detect signals of interest as compared with GLM-based and  conventional ICA harmonisation methods.},
