abstract: Combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from multi-site studies
  is a popular approach for constructing larger datasets to greatly enhance the  reliability
  and reproducibility of neuroscience research. However, the  scanner/site variability
  is a significant confound that complicates the  interpretation of the results, so
  effective and complete removal of the  scanner/site variability is necessary to
  realise the full advantages of pooling  multi-site datasets. Independent component
  analysis (ICA) and general linear  model (GLM) based harmonisation methods are the
  two primary methods used to  eliminate scanner/site effects. Unfortunately, there
  are challenges with both  ICA-based and GLM-based harmonisation methods to remove
  site effects completely  when the signals of interest and scanner/site effects-related
  variables are  correlated, which may occur in neuroscience studies. In this study,
  we propose an  effective and powerful harmonisation strategy that implements dual
  projection  (DP) theory based on ICA to remove the scanner/site effects more completely.
  This  method can separate the signal effects correlated with site variables from
  the  identified site effects for removal without losing signals of interest. Both  simulations
  and vivo structural MRI datasets, including a dataset from Autism  Brain Imaging
  Data Exchange II and a travelling subject dataset from the  Strategic Research Program
  for Brain Sciences, were used to test the performance  of a DP-based ICA harmonisation
  method. Results show that DP-based ICA  harmonisation has superior performance for
  removing site effects and enhancing  the sensitivity to detect signals of interest
  as compared with GLM-based and  conventional ICA harmonisation methods.
