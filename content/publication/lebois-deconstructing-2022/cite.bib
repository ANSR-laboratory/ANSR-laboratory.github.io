 abstract = {Trauma-related pathological dissociation is characterized by disruptions in one's sense of self, perceptual, and affective experience. Dissociation and its  trauma-related antecedents disproportionately impact women. However, despite the  gender-related prevalence and high individual and societal costs, dissociation  remains widely underappreciated in clinical practice. Moreover, dissociation  lacks a synthesized neurobiological model across its subtypes. Leveraging the  Triple Network Model of psychopathology, we sought to parse heterogeneity in  dissociative experience by examining functional connectivity of three core  neurocognitive networks as related to: (1) the dimensional dissociation subtypes  of depersonalization/derealization and partially-dissociated intrusions; and, (2)  the diagnostic category of dissociative identity disorder (DID). Participants  were 91 women with and without: a history of childhood trauma, current  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and varied levels of dissociation.  Participants provided clinical data about dissociation, PTSD symptoms, childhood  maltreatment history, and completed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance  imaging scan. We used a novel statistical approach to assess both overlapping and  unique contributions of dissociation subtypes. Covarying for age, childhood  maltreatment and PTSD severity, we found dissociation was linked to  hyperconnectivity within central executive (CEN), default (DN), and salience  networks (SN), and decreased connectivity of CEN and SN with other areas.  Moreover, we isolated unique connectivity markers associated with  depersonalization/derealization in CEN and DN, to partially-dissociated  intrusions in CEN, and to DID in CEN. This suggests dissociation subtypes have  robust functional connectivity signatures that may serve as targets for PTSD/DID  treatment engagement. Our findings underscore dissociation assessment as crucial  in clinical care, in particular, to reduce gender-related health disparities.},
