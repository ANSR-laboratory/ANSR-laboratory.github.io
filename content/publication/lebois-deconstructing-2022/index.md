abstract: "Trauma-related pathological dissociation is characterized by disruptions
  in one's sense of self, perceptual, and affective experience. Dissociation and its\
  \  trauma-related antecedents disproportionately impact women. However, despite
  the  gender-related prevalence and high individual and societal costs, dissociation\
  \  remains widely underappreciated in clinical practice. Moreover, dissociation\
  \  lacks a synthesized neurobiological model across its subtypes. Leveraging the\
  \  Triple Network Model of psychopathology, we sought to parse heterogeneity in\
  \  dissociative experience by examining functional connectivity of three core  neurocognitive
  networks as related to: (1) the dimensional dissociation subtypes  of depersonalization/derealization
  and partially-dissociated intrusions; and, (2)  the diagnostic category of dissociative
  identity disorder (DID). Participants  were 91 women with and without: a history
  of childhood trauma, current  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and varied levels
  of dissociation.  Participants provided clinical data about dissociation, PTSD symptoms,
  childhood  maltreatment history, and completed a resting-state functional magnetic
  resonance  imaging scan. We used a novel statistical approach to assess both overlapping
  and  unique contributions of dissociation subtypes. Covarying for age, childhood\
  \  maltreatment and PTSD severity, we found dissociation was linked to  hyperconnectivity
  within central executive (CEN), default (DN), and salience  networks (SN), and decreased
  connectivity of CEN and SN with other areas.  Moreover, we isolated unique connectivity
  markers associated with  depersonalization/derealization in CEN and DN, to partially-dissociated\
  \  intrusions in CEN, and to DID in CEN. This suggests dissociation subtypes have\
  \  robust functional connectivity signatures that may serve as targets for PTSD/DID\
  \  treatment engagement. Our findings underscore dissociation assessment as crucial\
  \  in clinical care, in particular, to reduce gender-related health disparities."
