 abstract = {In this work we use a computer simulation to estimate the magnitude of improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of PET functional brain mapping studies  as a function of partition coefficient and permeability surface product for O-14,  F-17, and O-15 labeled flow tracers. A model for signal-to-noise ratio is derived  from the Kety model for inert diffusible blood flow tracers. The results of the  simulation suggest that moderate increases in partition coefficient and  permeability surface product compared with water would lead to an increase in  signal-to-noise ratio of a factor of about 3.},
