abstract: In this work we use a computer simulation to estimate the magnitude of improvement
  in the signal-to-noise ratio of PET functional brain mapping studies  as a function
  of partition coefficient and permeability surface product for O-14,  F-17, and O-15
  labeled flow tracers. A model for signal-to-noise ratio is derived  from the Kety
  model for inert diffusible blood flow tracers. The results of the  simulation suggest
  that moderate increases in partition coefficient and  permeability surface product
  compared with water would lead to an increase in  signal-to-noise ratio of a factor
  of about 3.
