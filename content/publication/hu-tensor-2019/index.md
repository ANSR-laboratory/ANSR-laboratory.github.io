abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Stability of spatial components is frequently used as a post-hoc
  selection criteria for choosing the dimensionality of an independent component  analysis
  (ICA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Although the  stability
  of the ICA temporal courses differs from that of spatial components,  temporal stability
  has not been considered during dimensionality decisions. NEW  METHOD: The current
  study aims to (1) develop an algorithm to incorporate  temporal course stability
  into dimensionality selection and (2) test the impact  of temporal course on the
  stability of the ICA decomposition of fMRI data via  tensor clustering. Resting
  state fMRI data were analyzed with two popular ICA  algorithms, InfomaxICA and FastICA,
  using our new method and results were  compared with model order selection based
  on spatial or temporal criteria alone.  RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering indicated
  that the stability of the ICA  decomposition incorporating spatiotemporal tensor
  information performed similarly  when compared to current best practice. However,
  we found that component  spatiotemporal stability and convergence of the model varied
  significantly with  model order. Considering both may lead to methodological improvements
  for  determining ICA model order. Selected components were also significantly  associated
  with relevant behavioral variables. Comparison with Existing Method:  The Kullback-Leibler
  information criterion algorithm suggests the optimal model  order for group ICA
  is 40, compared to the proposed method with an optimal model  order of 20. CONCLUSION:
  The current study sheds new light on the importance of  temporal course variability
  in ICA of fMRI data.'
