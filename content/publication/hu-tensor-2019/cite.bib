 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stability of spatial components is frequently used as a post-hoc selection criteria for choosing the dimensionality of an independent component  analysis (ICA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Although the  stability of the ICA temporal courses differs from that of spatial components,  temporal stability has not been considered during dimensionality decisions. NEW  METHOD: The current study aims to (1) develop an algorithm to incorporate  temporal course stability into dimensionality selection and (2) test the impact  of temporal course on the stability of the ICA decomposition of fMRI data via  tensor clustering. Resting state fMRI data were analyzed with two popular ICA  algorithms, InfomaxICA and FastICA, using our new method and results were  compared with model order selection based on spatial or temporal criteria alone.  RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering indicated that the stability of the ICA  decomposition incorporating spatiotemporal tensor information performed similarly  when compared to current best practice. However, we found that component  spatiotemporal stability and convergence of the model varied significantly with  model order. Considering both may lead to methodological improvements for  determining ICA model order. Selected components were also significantly  associated with relevant behavioral variables. Comparison with Existing Method:  The Kullback-Leibler information criterion algorithm suggests the optimal model  order for group ICA is 40, compared to the proposed method with an optimal model  order of 20. CONCLUSION: The current study sheds new light on the importance of  temporal course variability in ICA of fMRI data.},
