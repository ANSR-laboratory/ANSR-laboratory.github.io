abstract: "Human brain networks mediating interoceptive, behavioral, and cognitive
  aspects of glycemic control are not well studied. Using group independent component\
  \  analysis with dual-regression approach of functional magnetic resonance imaging\
  \  data, we examined the functional connectivity changes of large-scale resting\
  \  state networks during sequential euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamp studies in  patients
  with type 1 diabetes and nondiabetic controls and how these changes  during hypoglycemia
  were related to symptoms of hypoglycemia awareness and to  concurrent glycosylated
  hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. During hypoglycemia, diabetic  patients showed increased
  functional connectivity of the right anterior insula  and the prefrontal cortex
  within the executive control network, which was  associated with higher HbA1c. Controls
  showed decreased functional connectivity  of the right anterior insula with the
  cerebellum/basal ganglia network and of  temporal regions within the temporal pole
  network and increased functional  connectivity in the default mode and sensorimotor
  networks. Functional  connectivity reductions in the right basal ganglia were correlated
  with increases  of self-reported hypoglycemic symptoms in controls but not in patients.
  Resting  state networks that showed different group functional connectivity during\
  \  hypoglycemia may be most sensitive to glycemic environment, and their  connectivity
  patterns may have adapted to repeated glycemic excursions present in  type 1 diabetes.
  Our results suggest that basal ganglia and insula mediation of  interoceptive awareness
  during hypoglycemia is altered in type 1 diabetes. These  changes could be neuroplastic
  adaptations to frequent hypoglycemic experiences.  Functional connectivity changes
  in the insula and prefrontal cognitive networks  could also reflect an adaptation
  to changes in brain metabolic pathways  associated with chronic hyperglycemia. SIGNIFICANCE
  STATEMENT: The major factor  limiting improved glucose control in type 1 diabetes
  is the significant increase  in hypoglycemia associated with insulin treatment.
  Repeated exposure to  hypoglycemia alters patients' ability to recognize the autonomic
  and  neuroglycopenic symptoms associated with low plasma glucose levels. We examined\
  \  brain resting state networks during the induction of hypoglycemia in diabetic
  and  control subjects and found differences in networks involved in sensorimotor\
  \  function, cognition, and interoceptive awareness that were related to chronic\
  \  levels of glycemic control. These findings identify brain regions that are  sensitive
  to variations in plasma glucose levels and may also provide a basis for  understanding
  the mechanisms underlying the increased incidence of cognitive  impairment and affective
  disorders seen in patients with diabetes."
