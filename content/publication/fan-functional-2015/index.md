abstract: 'Node definition or delineating how the brain is parcellated into individual
  functionally related regions is the first step to accurately map the human  connectome.
  As a result, parcellation of the human brain has drawn considerable  attention in
  the field of neuroscience. The thalamus is known as a relay in the  human brain,
  with its nuclei sending fibers to the cortical and subcortical  regions. Functional
  magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer a way to  parcellate the thalamus in
  vivo based on its connectivity properties. However,  the parcellations from previous
  studies show that both the number and the  distribution of thalamic subdivisions
  vary with different cortical segmentation  methods. In this study, we used an unsupervised
  clustering method that does not  rely on a priori information of the cortical segmentation
  to parcellate the  thalamus. Instead, this approach is based on the intrinsic resting-state  functional
  connectivity profiles of the thalamus with the whole brain. A series  of cluster
  solutions were obtained, and an optimal solution was determined.  Furthermore, the
  validity of our parcellation was investigated through the  following: (1) identifying
  specific resting-state connectivity patterns of  thalamic parcels with different
  brain networks and (2) investigating the task  activation and psychophysiological
  interactions of specific thalamic clusters  during 8-Hz flashing checkerboard stimulation
  with simultaneous finger tapping.  Together, the current study provides a reliable
  parcellation of the thalamus and  enhances our understating of thalamic. Furthermore,
  the current study provides a  framework for parcellation that could be potentially
  extended to other  subcortical and cortical regions.'
