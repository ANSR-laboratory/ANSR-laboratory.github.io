 abstract = {Modern neuroimaging studies frequently merge magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from multiple sites. A larger and more diverse group of participants can  increase the statistical power, enhance the reliability and reproducibility of  neuroimaging research, and obtain findings more representative of the general  population. However, measurement biases caused by site differences in scanners  represent a barrier when pooling data collected from different sites. The  existence of site effects can mask biological effects and lead to spurious  findings. We recently proposed a powerful denoising strategy that implements  dual-projection (DP) theory based on ICA to remove site-related effects from  pooled data, demonstrating the method for simulated and in vivo structural MRI  data. This study investigates the use of our DP-based ICA denoising method for  harmonizing functional MRI (fMRI) data collected from the Autism Brain Imaging  Data Exchange II. After frequency-domain and regional homogeneity analyses, two  modalities, including amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional  homogeneity (ReHo), were used to validate our method. The results indicate that  DP-based ICA denoising method removes unwanted site effects for both two fMRI  modalities, with increases in the significance of the associations between  non-imaging variables (age, sex, etc.) and fMRI measures. In conclusion, our DP  method can be applied to fMRI data in multi-site studies, enabling more accurate  and reliable neuroimaging research findings.},
