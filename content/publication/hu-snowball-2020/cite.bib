 abstract = {In independent component analysis (ICA), the selection of model order (i.e., number of components to be extracted) has crucial effects on functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) brain network analysis. Model order selection (MOS)  algorithms have been used to determine the number of estimated components.  However, simulations show that even when the model order equals the number of  simulated signal sources, traditional ICA algorithms may misestimate the spatial  maps of the signal sources. In principle, increasing model order will consider  more potential information in the estimation, and should therefore produce more  accurate results. However, this strategy may not work for fMRI because  large-scale networks are widely spatially distributed and thus have increased  mutual information with noise. As such, conventional ICA algorithms with high  model orders may not extract these components at all. This conflict makes the  selection of model order a problem. We present a new strategy for model order  free ICA, called Snowball ICA, that obviates these issues. The algorithm collects  all information for each network from fMRI data without the limitations of  network scale. Using simulations and in vivo resting-state fMRI data, our results  show that component estimation using Snowball ICA is more accurate than  traditional ICA.
