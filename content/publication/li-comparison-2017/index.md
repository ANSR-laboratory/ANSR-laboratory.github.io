abstract: Two powerful methods for statistical inference on MRI brain images have
  been proposed recently, a non-stationary voxelation-corrected cluster-size test
  (CST)  based on random field theory and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE)
  based  on calculating the level of local support for a cluster, then using permutation  testing
  for inference. Unlike other statistical approaches, these two methods do  not rest
  on the assumptions of a uniform and high degree of spatial smoothness of  the statistic
  image. Thus, they are strongly recommended for group-level fMRI  analysis compared
  to other statistical methods. In this work, the non-stationary  voxelation-corrected
  CST and TFCE methods for group-level analysis were evaluated  for both stationary
  and non-stationary images under varying smoothness levels,  degrees of freedom and
  signal to noise ratios. Our results suggest that, both  methods provide adequate
  control for the number of voxel-wise statistical tests  being performed during inference
  on fMRI data and they are both superior to  current CSTs implemented in popular
  MRI data analysis software packages. However,  TFCE is more sensitive and stable
  for group-level analysis of VBM data. Thus, the  voxelation-corrected CST approach
  may confer some advantages by being  computationally less demanding for fMRI data
  analysis than TFCE with permutation  testing and by also being applicable for single-subject
  fMRI analyses, while the  TFCE approach is advantageous for VBM data. Hum Brain
