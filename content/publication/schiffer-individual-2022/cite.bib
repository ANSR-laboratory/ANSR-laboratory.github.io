 abstract = {PURPOSE: Conventional theories of hemispheric emotional valence (HEV) postulate fixed hemispheric differences in emotional processing. Schiffer's dual brain  psychology proposes that there are prominent individual differences with a  substantial subset showing a reversed laterality pattern. He further proposed  that hemispheric differences were more akin to differences in personality than in  emotional processing. This theory is supported by findings that unilateral  treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, are effective if they  accurately target individual differences in laterality. The aim of this paper was  to assess if a computer test of hemispheric emotional valence (CTHEV) could  effectively identify individual differences in HEV and to ascertain if these  individual differences were associated with underlying differences in brain  structure and connectivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CTHEV was administered to  50 (18 male/32 female) right-handed participants, aged 18-19 years, enrolled in a  study assessing the neurobiological effects of childhood maltreatment. Based on a  literature review, we determined whether CTHEV correlated with lateralized  volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and subgenual anterior  cingulate as well as volume of the corpus callosum. RESULTS: CTHEV scores  correlated with laterality indices of the nucleus accumbens (p = 0.00016),  amygdala (p = 0.0138) and hippocampus (p = 0.031). A positive left hemispheric  valence was associated with a larger left-sided nucleus accumbens and hippocampus  and a smaller left amygdala. We identified four eigenvector network centrality  DTI measures that predict CTHEV, most notably the left amygdala, and found that  CTHEV results correlated with total and segment-specific corpus callosal volumes.  CONCLUSION: Individual differences in HEV can be readily assessed by computer  test and correlate with differences in brain structure and connectivity that  could provide a mechanistic understanding. These findings provide further support  for a revised understanding of HEV and provide a tool that could be used to guide  lateralized brain treatments.},
