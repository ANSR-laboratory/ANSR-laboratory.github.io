abstract: "PURPOSE: Conventional theories of hemispheric emotional valence (HEV) postulate
  fixed hemispheric differences in emotional processing. Schiffer's dual brain  psychology
  proposes that there are prominent individual differences with a  substantial subset
  showing a reversed laterality pattern. He further proposed  that hemispheric differences
  were more akin to differences in personality than in  emotional processing. This
  theory is supported by findings that unilateral  treatments, such as transcranial
  magnetic stimulation, are effective if they  accurately target individual differences
  in laterality. The aim of this paper was  to assess if a computer test of hemispheric
  emotional valence (CTHEV) could  effectively identify individual differences in
  HEV and to ascertain if these  individual differences were associated with underlying
  differences in brain  structure and connectivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CTHEV
  was administered to  50 (18 male/32 female) right-handed participants, aged 18-19
  years, enrolled in a  study assessing the neurobiological effects of childhood maltreatment.
  Based on a  literature review, we determined whether CTHEV correlated with lateralized\
  \  volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and subgenual anterior\
  \  cingulate as well as volume of the corpus callosum. RESULTS: CTHEV scores  correlated
  with laterality indices of the nucleus accumbens (p = 0.00016),  amygdala (p = 0.0138)
  and hippocampus (p = 0.031). A positive left hemispheric  valence was associated
  with a larger left-sided nucleus accumbens and hippocampus  and a smaller left amygdala.
  We identified four eigenvector network centrality  DTI measures that predict CTHEV,
  most notably the left amygdala, and found that  CTHEV results correlated with total
  and segment-specific corpus callosal volumes.  CONCLUSION: Individual differences
  in HEV can be readily assessed by computer  test and correlate with differences
  in brain structure and connectivity that  could provide a mechanistic understanding.
  These findings provide further support  for a revised understanding of HEV and provide
  a tool that could be used to guide  lateralized brain treatments."
