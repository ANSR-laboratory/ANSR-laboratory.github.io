abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Brain dysfunction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal striatum
  (DS) contributes to habitual drug use. These regions are constituents of brain  networks
  thought to be involved in drug addiction. To investigate whether  networks containing
  these regions differ between nicotine dependent female  smokers and age-matched
  female non-smokers, we employed functional MRI (fMRI) at  rest. METHODS: Data were
  processed with independent component analysis (ICA) to  identify resting state networks
  (RSNs). We identified a subcortical limbic  network and three discrete PFC networks:
  a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)  network and right and left lateralized fronto-parietal
  networks common to all  subjects. We then compared these RSNs between smokers and
  non-smokers using a  dual regression approach. RESULTS: Smokers had greater coupling
  versus  non-smokers between left fronto-parietal and mPFC networks. Smokers with
  the  greatest mPFC-left fronto-parietal coupling had the most DS smoking cue  reactivity
  as measured during an fMRI smoking cue reactivity paradigm. This may  be important
  because the DS plays a critical role in maintaining drug-cue  associations. Furthermore,
  subcortical limbic network amplitude was greater in  smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
  suggest that prefrontal brain networks are more  strongly coupled in smokers, which
  could facilitate drug-cue responding. Our data  also are the first to document greater
  reward-related network fMRI amplitude in  smokers. Our findings suggest that resting
  state PFC network interactions and  limbic network amplitude can differentiate nicotine-dependent
  smokers from  controls, and may serve as biomarkers for nicotine dependence severity
  and  treatment efficacy.'
