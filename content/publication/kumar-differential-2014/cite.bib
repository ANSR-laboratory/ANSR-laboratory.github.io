 abstract = {Anhedonia is one of the core symptoms of depression and has been linked to blunted responses to rewarding stimuli in striatal regions. Stress, a key  vulnerability factor for depression, has been shown to induce anhedonic behavior,  including reduced reward responsiveness in both animals and humans, but the brain  processes associated with these effects remain largely unknown in humans.  Emerging evidence suggests that stress has dissociable effects on distinct  components of reward processing, as it has been found to potentiate  motivation/'wanting' during the anticipatory phase but reduce reward  responsiveness/'liking' during the consummatory phase. To examine the impact of  stress on reward processing, we used a monetary incentive delay (MID) task and an  acute stress manipulation (negative performance feedback) in conjunction with  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy participants  performed the MID task under no-stress and stress conditions. We hypothesized  that stress would have dissociable effects on the anticipatory and consummatory  phases in reward-related brain regions. Specifically, we expected reduced  striatal responsiveness during reward consumption (mirroring patterns previously  observed in clinical depression) and increased striatal activation during reward  anticipation consistent with non-human findings. Supporting our hypotheses,  significant Phase (Anticipation/Consumption)×Stress (Stress/No-stress)  interactions emerged in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, caudate and amygdala.  Post hoc tests revealed that stress increased striatal and amygdalar activation  during anticipation but decreased striatal activation during consumption.  Importantly, stress-induced striatal blunting was similar to the profile observed  in clinical depression under baseline (no-stress) conditions in prior studies.  Given that stress is a pivotal vulnerability factor for depression, these results  offer insight to better understand the etiology of this prevalent disorder.},
