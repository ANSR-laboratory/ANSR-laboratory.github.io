abstract: Anhedonia is one of the core symptoms of depression and has been linked
  to blunted responses to rewarding stimuli in striatal regions. Stress, a key  vulnerability
  factor for depression, has been shown to induce anhedonic behavior,  including reduced
  reward responsiveness in both animals and humans, but the brain  processes associated
  with these effects remain largely unknown in humans.  Emerging evidence suggests
  that stress has dissociable effects on distinct  components of reward processing,
  as it has been found to potentiate  motivation/'wanting' during the anticipatory
  phase but reduce reward  responsiveness/'liking' during the consummatory phase.
  To examine the impact of  stress on reward processing, we used a monetary incentive
  delay (MID) task and an  acute stress manipulation (negative performance feedback)
  in conjunction with  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy
  participants  performed the MID task under no-stress and stress conditions. We hypothesized  that
  stress would have dissociable effects on the anticipatory and consummatory  phases
  in reward-related brain regions. Specifically, we expected reduced  striatal responsiveness
  during reward consumption (mirroring patterns previously  observed in clinical depression)
  and increased striatal activation during reward  anticipation consistent with non-human
  findings. Supporting our hypotheses,  significant Phase (Anticipation/Consumption)Ã—Stress
  (Stress/No-stress)  interactions emerged in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, caudate
  and amygdala.  Post hoc tests revealed that stress increased striatal and amygdalar
  activation  during anticipation but decreased striatal activation during consumption.  Importantly,
  stress-induced striatal blunting was similar to the profile observed  in clinical
  depression under baseline (no-stress) conditions in prior studies.  Given that stress
  is a pivotal vulnerability factor for depression, these results  offer insight to
  better understand the etiology of this prevalent disorder.
