 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most studies of brain white matter (WM) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have focused on combat trauma, and often were confounded by  neurological and substance dependence comorbidity. This study used tract-based  spatial statistics (TBSS) and probabilistic tractography to characterize WM  microstructure in a mixed-sex community sample of PTSD patients exposed to  diverse and multiple traumas, and in trauma-exposed normal comparison (TENC)  subjects. METHODS: TBSS compared diffusion measures between 20 adults with DSM-IV  PTSD and 17 TENC, using a whole-brain voxel-wise approach. Probabilistic  tractography using Freesurfer's TRACULA was employed to measure diffusion tensor  imaging (DTI) metrics within anatomically defined pathways. DTI metrics were  compared between groups and correlated with PTSD symptom severity and trauma  load. RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, and motion, PTSD subjects had  significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in a left frontal lobe cluster  compared with TENC, at p \textless .05, family-wise error corrected. Tractography  identified significant group differences in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus  (ILF), including lower FA and higher radial diffusivity in PTSD compared with  TENC. Within the PTSD group, FA values were not correlated with symptom severity  or trauma load. Results remained significant after removing participants using  psychotropic medication or those with comorbid major depression. CONCLUSIONS:  PTSD patients had reduced WM integrity in left hemisphere frontal WM and  temporal-occipital WM tracts, compared to trauma-exposed controls. Reduced  frontal FA is consistent with compromised top-down attentional control and  emotion regulation in PTSD, while reduced ILF FA may be related to sensory  processing and gating abnormalities in this disorder.},
