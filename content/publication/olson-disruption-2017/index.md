abstract: "BACKGROUND: Most studies of brain white matter (WM) in posttraumatic stress
  disorder (PTSD) have focused on combat trauma, and often were confounded by  neurological
  and substance dependence comorbidity. This study used tract-based  spatial statistics
  (TBSS) and probabilistic tractography to characterize WM  microstructure in a mixed-sex
  community sample of PTSD patients exposed to  diverse and multiple traumas, and
  in trauma-exposed normal comparison (TENC)  subjects. METHODS: TBSS compared diffusion
  measures between 20 adults with DSM-IV  PTSD and 17 TENC, using a whole-brain voxel-wise
  approach. Probabilistic  tractography using Freesurfer's TRACULA was employed to
  measure diffusion tensor  imaging (DTI) metrics within anatomically defined pathways.
  DTI metrics were  compared between groups and correlated with PTSD symptom severity
  and trauma  load. RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, and motion, PTSD subjects had\
  \  significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in a left frontal lobe cluster\
  \  compared with TENC, at p textless .05, family-wise error corrected. Tractography\
  \  identified significant group differences in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus\
  \  (ILF), including lower FA and higher radial diffusivity in PTSD compared with\
  \  TENC. Within the PTSD group, FA values were not correlated with symptom severity\
  \  or trauma load. Results remained significant after removing participants using\
  \  psychotropic medication or those with comorbid major depression. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \  PTSD patients had reduced WM integrity in left hemisphere frontal WM and  temporal-occipital
  WM tracts, compared to trauma-exposed controls. Reduced  frontal FA is consistent
  with compromised top-down attentional control and  emotion regulation in PTSD, while
  reduced ILF FA may be related to sensory  processing and gating abnormalities in
  this disorder."
