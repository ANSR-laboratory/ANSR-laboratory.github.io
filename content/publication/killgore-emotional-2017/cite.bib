 abstract = {Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined as an individual's capacity to accurately perceive, understand, reason about, and regulate emotions, and to apply that  information to facilitate thought and achieve goals. Although EI plays an  important role in mental health and success in academic, professional and social  realms, the neurocircuitry underlying this capacity remains poorly characterized,  and no study to date has yet examined the relationship between EI and intrinsic  neural network function. Here, in a sample of 54 healthy individuals (28 women,  26 men), we apply independent components analysis (ICA) with dual regression to  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired while subjects were  resting in the scanner to investigate brain circuits (intrinsic resting state  networks) whose activity is associated with greater self-reported (i.e. Trait)  and objectively measured (i.e. Ability) EI. We show that higher Ability EI, but  not Trait EI, is associated with stronger negatively correlated spontaneous fMRI  signals between the basal ganglia/limbic network (BGN) and posterior default mode  network (DMN), and regions involved in emotional processing and regulation.  Importantly, these findings suggest that the functional connectivity within and  between intrinsic networks associated with mentation, affective regulation,  emotion processing, and reward are strongly related to ability EI.},
