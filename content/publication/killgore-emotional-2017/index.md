abstract: Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined as an individual's capacity to accurately
  perceive, understand, reason about, and regulate emotions, and to apply that  information
  to facilitate thought and achieve goals. Although EI plays an  important role in
  mental health and success in academic, professional and social  realms, the neurocircuitry
  underlying this capacity remains poorly characterized,  and no study to date has
  yet examined the relationship between EI and intrinsic  neural network function.
  Here, in a sample of 54 healthy individuals (28 women,  26 men), we apply independent
  components analysis (ICA) with dual regression to  functional magnetic resonance
  imaging (fMRI) data acquired while subjects were  resting in the scanner to investigate
  brain circuits (intrinsic resting state  networks) whose activity is associated
  with greater self-reported (i.e. Trait)  and objectively measured (i.e. Ability)
  EI. We show that higher Ability EI, but  not Trait EI, is associated with stronger
  negatively correlated spontaneous fMRI  signals between the basal ganglia/limbic
  network (BGN) and posterior default mode  network (DMN), and regions involved in
  emotional processing and regulation.  Importantly, these findings suggest that the
  functional connectivity within and  between intrinsic networks associated with mentation,
  affective regulation,  emotion processing, and reward are strongly related to ability
  EI.
