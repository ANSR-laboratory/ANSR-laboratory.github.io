 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Family dementia caregivers experience high rates of depression and anxiety that often go untreated due to time demands. We aimed to determine the  feasibility of a brief, 4-week Mentalizing Imagery Therapy intervention, which  couples mindfulness with guided imagery practices aimed at bolstering mentalizing  capacity, to reduce caregiver psychological symptoms and to explore potential  impact on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity. METHODS: Twenty-four  family dementia caregivers with moderate depression symptoms (a score of 10 in  Patient Health Questionnaire-9) were assigned to either group Mentalizing Imagery  Therapy (MIT, n = 12) or a waitlist augmented by optional relaxation exercises (n  = 12). Participants completed questionnaires to measure depression and anxiety at  baseline and followup, and those eligible also underwent resting state functional  magnetic resonance (fMRI) brain imaging at these time points. RESULTS: Eleven of  12 caregivers assigned to MIT completed the intervention and attended weekly  groups 98% of the time. MIT home practice logs indicated average practice of 5 ±  2 sessions per week for 23 ± 8 min per session. All participants in waitlist  completed the post-assessment. MIT participants exhibited significantly greater  improvement than waitlist on self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms  (p\textless.05) after 4 weeks. Neuroimaging results revealed increased dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex connectivity with a putative emotion regulation network in the  MIT group (p = .05) but not in waitlist (p = 1.0). LIMITATIONS: Sample size  limitations necessitate validation of findings in larger, randomized controlled  trials. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week group MIT program was feasible for caregivers, with  high levels of participation in weekly group meetings and home practice  exercises.},
