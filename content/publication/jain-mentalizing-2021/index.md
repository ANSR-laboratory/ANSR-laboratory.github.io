abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Family dementia caregivers experience high rates of depression
  and anxiety that often go untreated due to time demands. We aimed to determine the  feasibility
  of a brief, 4-week Mentalizing Imagery Therapy intervention, which  couples mindfulness
  with guided imagery practices aimed at bolstering mentalizing  capacity, to reduce
  caregiver psychological symptoms and to explore potential  impact on dorsolateral
  prefrontal cortex connectivity. METHODS: Twenty-four  family dementia caregivers
  with moderate depression symptoms (a score of 10 in  Patient Health Questionnaire-9)
  were assigned to either group Mentalizing Imagery  Therapy (MIT, n = 12) or a waitlist
  augmented by optional relaxation exercises (n  = 12). Participants completed questionnaires
  to measure depression and anxiety at  baseline and followup, and those eligible
  also underwent resting state functional  magnetic resonance (fMRI) brain imaging
  at these time points. RESULTS: Eleven of  12 caregivers assigned to MIT completed
  the intervention and attended weekly  groups 98% of the time. MIT home practice
  logs indicated average practice of 5 ±  2 sessions per week for 23 ± 8 min per session.
  All participants in waitlist  completed the post-assessment. MIT participants exhibited
  significantly greater  improvement than waitlist on self-reported depression and
  anxiety symptoms  (ptextless.05) after 4 weeks. Neuroimaging results revealed increased
  dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex connectivity with a putative emotion regulation
  network in the  MIT group (p = .05) but not in waitlist (p = 1.0). LIMITATIONS:
  Sample size  limitations necessitate validation of findings in larger, randomized
  controlled  trials. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week group MIT program was feasible for caregivers,
  with  high levels of participation in weekly group meetings and home practice  exercises.'
