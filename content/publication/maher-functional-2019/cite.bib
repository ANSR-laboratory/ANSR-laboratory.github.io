 abstract = {Patients with schizophrenia show impairment in processing faces, including facial affect and face detection, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We used  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize resting state  functional connectivity between an independent component analysis (ICA)-defined  early visual cortical network (corresponding to regions in V1, V2, V3) and a  priori defined face-processing regions (fusiform face area [FFA], occipital face  area [OFA], superior temporal sulcus [STS] and amygdala) using dual regression in  20 schizophrenia patients and 26 healthy controls. We also investigated the  association between resting functional connectivity and neural responses (fMRI)  elicited by a face detection paradigm in a partially overlapping sample (Maher et  al., 2016) that used stimuli equated for lower-level perceptual abilities. Group  differences in functional connectivity were found in right FFA only; controls  showed significantly stronger functional connectivity to an early visual cortical  network. Functional connectivity in right FFA was associated with (a) neural  responses during face detection in controls only, and (b) perceptual detection  thresholds for faces in patients only. The finding of impaired functional  connectivity for right FFA (but not other queried domain-specific regions)  converges with findings investigating face detection in an overlapping sample in  which dysfunction was found exclusively for right FFA in schizophrenia during  face detection.},
