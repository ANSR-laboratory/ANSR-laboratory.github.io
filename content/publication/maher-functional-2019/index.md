abstract: Patients with schizophrenia show impairment in processing faces, including
  facial affect and face detection, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We
  used  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize resting state  functional
  connectivity between an independent component analysis (ICA)-defined  early visual
  cortical network (corresponding to regions in V1, V2, V3) and a  priori defined
  face-processing regions (fusiform face area [FFA], occipital face  area [OFA], superior
  temporal sulcus [STS] and amygdala) using dual regression in  20 schizophrenia patients
  and 26 healthy controls. We also investigated the  association between resting functional
  connectivity and neural responses (fMRI)  elicited by a face detection paradigm
  in a partially overlapping sample (Maher et  al., 2016) that used stimuli equated
  for lower-level perceptual abilities. Group  differences in functional connectivity
  were found in right FFA only; controls  showed significantly stronger functional
  connectivity to an early visual cortical  network. Functional connectivity in right
  FFA was associated with (a) neural  responses during face detection in controls
  only, and (b) perceptual detection  thresholds for faces in patients only. The finding
  of impaired functional  connectivity for right FFA (but not other queried domain-specific
  regions)  converges with findings investigating face detection in an overlapping
  sample in  which dysfunction was found exclusively for right FFA in schizophrenia
  during  face detection.
