abstract: 'In this work, a compartmental model to predict the concentration of hyperpolarized
  xenon (Xe) in the brain is developed based on the well established  kinetics of
  Xe and estimated T1 values for the compartments. For the gaseous  compartments,
  T1 was set to 12 seconds. For the tissue compartments, T1 was set  to 6 seconds.
  Three gas delivery techniques were modeled: hyperventilation  followed by breath-hold,
  continual breathing, and hyperventilation followed by  continual breathing. Based
  on Xe CT, it is estimated that the maximum  concentration of Xe that could be breathed
  is 80%. Based on this value and the  estimated maximum polarization of 50%, the
  peak gray matter concentration of  hyperpolarized Xe is calculated to be .036 mM.
  This leads to an estimated  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), at 2 T, for hyperpolarized
  Xe that is a factor of 50  lower than the SNR for proton MRI. The peak concentration
  of hyperpolarized Xe  was also calculated over a wide range of gas and tissue T1
  values. This model  also predicts that the arterial blood will have a concentration
  of hyperpolarized  Xe that is 10 times greater than the concentration in gray matter.
  An interactive  version of the model can be found on the World Wide Web at  http:(/)/ric.uthscsa.edu/staff
