abstract: Cluster-size tests (CSTs) based on random field theory (RFT) are commonly
  adopted to identify significant differences in brain images. However, the use of
  RFT in  CSTs rests on the assumption of uniform smoothness (stationarity). When
  images  are non-stationary, CSTs based on RFT will likely lead to increased false  positives
  in smooth regions and reduced power in rough regions. An adjustment to  the cluster
  size according to the local smoothness at each voxel has been  proposed for the
  standard test based on RFT to address non-stationarity, however,  this technique
  requires images with a large degree of spatial smoothing, large  degrees of freedom
  and high intensity thresholding. Recently, we proposed a  voxelation-corrected 3D
  CST based on Gaussian random field theory that does not  place constraints on the
  degree of spatial smoothness. However, this approach is  only applicable to stationary
  images, requiring further modification to enable  use for non-stationary images.
  In this study, we present modifications of this  method to develop a voxelation-corrected
  non-stationary 3D CST based on RFT. Both  simulated and real data were used to compare
  the voxelation-corrected  non-stationary CST to the standard cluster-size adjusted
  non-stationary CST based  on RFT and the voxelation-corrected stationary CST. We
  found that  voxelation-corrected stationary CST is liberal for non-stationary images
  and the  voxelation-corrected non-stationary CST performs better than cluster-size  adjusted
  non-stationary CST based on RFT under low smoothness, low intensity  threshold and
  low degrees of freedom.
