 abstract = {Cluster-size tests (CSTs) based on random field theory (RFT) are commonly adopted to identify significant differences in brain images. However, the use of RFT in  CSTs rests on the assumption of uniform smoothness (stationarity). When images  are non-stationary, CSTs based on RFT will likely lead to increased false  positives in smooth regions and reduced power in rough regions. An adjustment to  the cluster size according to the local smoothness at each voxel has been  proposed for the standard test based on RFT to address non-stationarity, however,  this technique requires images with a large degree of spatial smoothing, large  degrees of freedom and high intensity thresholding. Recently, we proposed a  voxelation-corrected 3D CST based on Gaussian random field theory that does not  place constraints on the degree of spatial smoothness. However, this approach is  only applicable to stationary images, requiring further modification to enable  use for non-stationary images. In this study, we present modifications of this  method to develop a voxelation-corrected non-stationary 3D CST based on RFT. Both  simulated and real data were used to compare the voxelation-corrected  non-stationary CST to the standard cluster-size adjusted non-stationary CST based  on RFT and the voxelation-corrected stationary CST. We found that  voxelation-corrected stationary CST is liberal for non-stationary images and the  voxelation-corrected non-stationary CST performs better than cluster-size  adjusted non-stationary CST based on RFT under low smoothness, low intensity  threshold and low degrees of freedom.},
