 abstract = {Face detection, the perceptual capacity to identify a visual stimulus as a face before probing deeper into specific attributes (such as its identity or emotion),  is essential for social functioning. Despite the importance of this functional  capacity, face detection and its underlying brain mechanisms are not well  understood. This study evaluated the roles that the cortical face processing  system, which is identified largely through studying other aspects of face  perception, play in face detection. Specifically, we used functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the activations of the fusifom face area  (FFA), occipital face area (OFA) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) when face  detection was isolated from other aspects of face perception and when face  detection was perceptually-equated across individual human participants (n=20).  During face detection, FFA and OFA were significantly activated, even for stimuli  presented at perceptual-threshold levels, whereas STS was not. During tree  detection, however, FFA and OFA were responsive only for highly salient (i.e.,  high contrast) stimuli. Moreover, activation of FFA during face detection  predicted a significant portion of the perceptual performance levels that were  determined psychophysically for each participant. This pattern of result  indicates that FFA and OFA have a greater sensitivity to face detection signals  and selectively support the initial process of face vs. non-face object  perception.},
