 abstract = {The purpose of this report is to implement novel modifications to overcome the limitations of an existing algorithm for estimating the local statistical noise  in a positron emission tomography (PET) image without performing repeated  measures. The original algorithm is based on a modification of the filtered  back-projection algorithm that allows the variance to be estimated using only a  single sinogram. In addition, the effects of photon absorption, random  coincidences, radioactive decay, and detector nonuniformity are taken into  account. However, there are some limitations when applying this method with  modern scanners. In particular, it is common practice to interleave the  projections in the sinogram (to increase the sampling rate along each projection)  and to perform an interpolation when actually back-projecting to reconstruct the  images. Both of these procedures introduce covariance among the elements of the  projections, which is cumbersome and impractical to deal with using the existing  technique for creating a variance image. An alternative image reconstruction  scheme that is shown to be equivalent to image reconstruction using traditional  filtered back-projection greatly simplifies the estimation of the variance image.  The proposed methods were tested by Monte Carlo simulations and by using repeated  scans of a uniform phantom filled with F-18. Results demonstrate that the  proposed methods are very rigorous and stable when compared to calculations of  the local variance using either repeated measures with a large number of  measurements, or region-of-interest estimates of the variance, assuming  homogeneous variance structure. In addition, strategies for extending the  proposed technique are discussed that would permit the estimation of the variance  due to measurement error of a pixel in a brain map from both single subjects and  pooled group data.},
