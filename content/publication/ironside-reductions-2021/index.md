abstract: The interplay between cortical and limbic regions in stress circuitry calls
  for a neural systems approach to investigations of acute stress responses in major  depressive
  disorder (MDD). Advances in multimodal imaging allow inferences  between regional
  neurotransmitter function and activation in circuits linked to  MDD, which could
  inform treatment development. The current study investigated the  role of the inhibitory
  neurotransmitter GABA in stress circuitry in females with  current and remitted
  MDD. Multimodal imaging data were analyzed from 49 young  female adults across three
  groups (current MDD, remitted MDD (rMDD), and healthy  controls). GABA was assessed
  at baseline using magnetic resonance spectroscopy,  and functional MRI data were
  collected before, during, and after an acute  stressor and analyzed using a network
  modeling approach. The MDD group showed an  overall lower cortisol response than
  the rMDD group and lower rostral anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA than healthy
  controls. Across groups, stress  decreased activation in the frontoparietal network
  (FPN) but increased activation  in the default mode network (DMN) and a network
  encompassing the ventromedial  prefrontal cortex-striatum-anterior cingulate cortex
  (vmPFC-Str-ACC). Relative to  controls, the MDD and rMDD groups were characterized
  by decreased FPN and  salience network (SN) activation overall. Rostral ACC GABA
  was positively  associated with connectivity between an overlapping limbic network  (Temporal-Insula-Amygdala)
  and two other circuits (FPN and DMN). Collectively,  these findings indicate that
  reduced GABA in females with MDD was associated with  connectivity differences within
  and across key networks implicated in depression.  GABAergic treatments for MDD
  might alleviate stress circuitry abnormalities in  females.
