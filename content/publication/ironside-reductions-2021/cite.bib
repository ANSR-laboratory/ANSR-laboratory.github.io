 abstract = {The interplay between cortical and limbic regions in stress circuitry calls for a neural systems approach to investigations of acute stress responses in major  depressive disorder (MDD). Advances in multimodal imaging allow inferences  between regional neurotransmitter function and activation in circuits linked to  MDD, which could inform treatment development. The current study investigated the  role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in stress circuitry in females with  current and remitted MDD. Multimodal imaging data were analyzed from 49 young  female adults across three groups (current MDD, remitted MDD (rMDD), and healthy  controls). GABA was assessed at baseline using magnetic resonance spectroscopy,  and functional MRI data were collected before, during, and after an acute  stressor and analyzed using a network modeling approach. The MDD group showed an  overall lower cortisol response than the rMDD group and lower rostral anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA than healthy controls. Across groups, stress  decreased activation in the frontoparietal network (FPN) but increased activation  in the default mode network (DMN) and a network encompassing the ventromedial  prefrontal cortex-striatum-anterior cingulate cortex (vmPFC-Str-ACC). Relative to  controls, the MDD and rMDD groups were characterized by decreased FPN and  salience network (SN) activation overall. Rostral ACC GABA was positively  associated with connectivity between an overlapping limbic network  (Temporal-Insula-Amygdala) and two other circuits (FPN and DMN). Collectively,  these findings indicate that reduced GABA in females with MDD was associated with  connectivity differences within and across key networks implicated in depression.  GABAergic treatments for MDD might alleviate stress circuitry abnormalities in  females.},
