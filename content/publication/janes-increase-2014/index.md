abstract: Craving is a key aspect of drug dependence that is thought to motivate continued
  drug use. Numerous brain regions have been associated with craving, suggesting  that
  craving is mediated by a distributed brain network. Whether an increase in  subjective
  craving is associated with enhanced interactions among brain regions  was evaluated
  using resting state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in nicotine  dependent participants.
  We focused on craving-related changes in the orbital and  medial prefrontal cortex
  (OMPFC) network, which also included the subgenual  anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC)
  extending into the ventral striatum. Brain  regions in the OMPFC network are not
  only implicated in addiction and reward,  but, due to their rich anatomic interconnections,
  may serve as the site of  integration across craving-related brain regions. Subjective
  craving and resting  state fMRI were evaluated twice with an âˆ¼1 hour delay between
  the scans.  Cigarette craving was significantly increased at the end, relative to
  the  beginning of the scan session. Enhanced craving was associated with heightened  coupling
  between the OMPFC network and other cortical, limbic, striatal, and  visceromotor
  brain regions that are both anatomically interconnected with the  OMPFC, and have
  been implicated in addiction and craving. This is the first  demonstration confirming
  that an increase in craving is associated with enhanced  brain region interactions,
  which may play a role in the experience of craving.
