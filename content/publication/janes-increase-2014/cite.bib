 abstract = {Craving is a key aspect of drug dependence that is thought to motivate continued drug use. Numerous brain regions have been associated with craving, suggesting  that craving is mediated by a distributed brain network. Whether an increase in  subjective craving is associated with enhanced interactions among brain regions  was evaluated using resting state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in nicotine  dependent participants. We focused on craving-related changes in the orbital and  medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) network, which also included the subgenual  anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) extending into the ventral striatum. Brain  regions in the OMPFC network are not only implicated in addiction and reward,  but, due to their rich anatomic interconnections, may serve as the site of  integration across craving-related brain regions. Subjective craving and resting  state fMRI were evaluated twice with an âˆ¼1 hour delay between the scans.  Cigarette craving was significantly increased at the end, relative to the  beginning of the scan session. Enhanced craving was associated with heightened  coupling between the OMPFC network and other cortical, limbic, striatal, and  visceromotor brain regions that are both anatomically interconnected with the  OMPFC, and have been implicated in addiction and craving. This is the first  demonstration confirming that an increase in craving is associated with enhanced  brain region interactions, which may play a role in the experience of craving.},
