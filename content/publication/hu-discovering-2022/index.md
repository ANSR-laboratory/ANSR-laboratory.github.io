abstract: The study of brain network interactions during naturalistic stimuli facilitates
  a deeper understanding of human brain function. To estimate large-scale brain  networks
  evoked with naturalistic stimuli, a tensor component analysis (TCA)  based framework
  was used to characterize shared spatio-temporal patterns across  subjects in a purely
  data-driven manner. In this framework, a third-order tensor  is constructed from
  the timeseries extracted from all brain regions from a given  parcellation, for
  all participants, with modes of the tensor corresponding to  spatial distribution,
  time series and participants. TCA then reveals spatially  and temporally shared
  components, i.e., evoked networks with the naturalistic  stimuli, their time courses
  of activity and subject loadings of each component.  To enhance the reproducibility
  of the estimation with the adaptive TCA algorithm,  a novel spectral clustering
  method, tensor spectral clustering, was proposed and  applied to evaluate the stability
  of the TCA algorithm. We demonstrated the  effectiveness of the proposed framework
  via simulations and real fMRI data  collected during a motor task with a traditional
  fMRI study design. We also  applied the proposed framework to fMRI data collected
  during passive movie  watching to illustrate how reproducible brain networks are
  evoked by naturalistic  movie viewing.
