 abstract = {The study of brain network interactions during naturalistic stimuli facilitates a deeper understanding of human brain function. To estimate large-scale brain  networks evoked with naturalistic stimuli, a tensor component analysis (TCA)  based framework was used to characterize shared spatio-temporal patterns across  subjects in a purely data-driven manner. In this framework, a third-order tensor  is constructed from the timeseries extracted from all brain regions from a given  parcellation, for all participants, with modes of the tensor corresponding to  spatial distribution, time series and participants. TCA then reveals spatially  and temporally shared components, i.e., evoked networks with the naturalistic  stimuli, their time courses of activity and subject loadings of each component.  To enhance the reproducibility of the estimation with the adaptive TCA algorithm,  a novel spectral clustering method, tensor spectral clustering, was proposed and  applied to evaluate the stability of the TCA algorithm. We demonstrated the  effectiveness of the proposed framework via simulations and real fMRI data  collected during a motor task with a traditional fMRI study design. We also  applied the proposed framework to fMRI data collected during passive movie  watching to illustrate how reproducible brain networks are evoked by naturalistic  movie viewing.},
