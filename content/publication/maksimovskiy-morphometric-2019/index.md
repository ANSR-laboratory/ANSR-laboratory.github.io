abstract: 'BACKGROUND: While many adolescents exhibit risky behavior, teenagers with
  a family history (FH+) of an alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at a heightened risk  for
  earlier initiation of alcohol use, a more rapid escalation in frequency and  quantity
  of alcohol consumption and developing a subsequent AUD in comparison  with youth
  without such family history (FH-). Neuroanatomically, developmentally  normative
  risk-taking behavior parallels an imbalance between more protracted  development
  of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and earlier development of limbic  regions. Magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI)-derived volumetric properties were  obtained for these structures
  in FH+ and FH- adolescents. METHODS: Forty-two  substance-naïve adolescents (13-
  to 14-year-olds), stratified into FH+ (N = 19,  13 girls) and FH- (N = 23, 11 girls)
  age/handedness-matched groups, completed MRI  scanning at 3.0T, as well as cognitive
  and clinical testing. T1 images were  processed using FreeSurfer to measure PFC
  and hippocampi/amygdalae  subfields/nuclei volumes. RESULTS: FH+ status was associated
  with larger  hippocampal/amygdala volumes (p textless 0.05), relative to FH- adolescents,
  with right  amygdala results appearing to be driven by FH+ boys. Volumetric differences
  also  were positively associated with family history density (p textless 0.05) of
  having an  AUD. Larger subfields/nuclei volumes were associated with higher anxiety
  levels  and worse auditory verbal learning performance (p textless 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
  FH+ risk  for AUD is detectable via neuromorphometric characteristics, which precede  alcohol
  use onset and the potential onset of a later AUD, that are associated  with emotional
  and cognitive measures. It is plausible that the development of  limbic regions
  might be altered in FH+ youth, even prior to the onset of alcohol  use, which could
  increase later risk. Thus, targeted preventative measures are  warranted that serve
  to delay the onset of alcohol use in youth, particularly in  those who are FH+ for
  an AUD.'
