abstract: The frontal cortex undergoes substantial structural and functional changes
  during adolescence and significant developmental changes also occur in the hippocampus.  Both
  of these regions are notably vulnerable to alcohol and other substance use,  which
  is typically initiated during adolescence. Identifying measures of brain  function
  during adolescence, particularly before initiation of drug or alcohol  use, is critical
  to understanding how such behaviors may affect brain  development, especially in
  these vulnerable brain regions. While there is a  substantial developmental literature
  on adolescent working memory, less is known  about spatial memory. Thus, a virtual
  Morris water task (vMWT) was applied to  probe function of the adolescent hippocampus.
  Multiband blood oxygen level  dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) data were acquired  at 3T during task performance. Participants included
  32 healthy, alcohol- and  drug-na√Øve adolescents, 13-14 years old, examined at baseline
  of a 3-year  longitudinal MRI study. Significantly greater BOLD activation was observed
  in the  hippocampus and surrounding areas, and in prefrontal regions involved in  executive
  function, during retrieval relative to motor performance. In contrast,  significantly
  greater BOLD activation was observed in components of the default  mode network,
  including frontal medial cortex, during the motor condition (when  task demands
  were minimal) relative to the retrieval condition. Worse performance  (longer path
  length) during retrieval was associated with greater activation of  angular gyrus/supramarginal
  gyrus, whereas worse performance (longer path  length/latency) during motor control
  was associated with less activation of  frontal pole. Furthermore, while latency
  (time to complete task) was greater in  females than in males, there were no sex
  differences in path length (accuracy),  suggesting that females required more time
  to navigate the virtual environment,  but did so as effectively as males. These
  findings demonstrate that performance  of the vMWT elicits hippocampal and prefrontal
  activation patterns in early  adolescence, similar to activation observed during
  spatial memory retrieval in  adults. Given that this task is sensitive to hippocampal
  function, and that the  adolescent hippocampus is notably vulnerable to the effects
  of alcohol and other  substances, data acquired using this task during healthy adolescent
  development  may provide a framework for understanding neurobiological impact of
  later  initiation of use.
