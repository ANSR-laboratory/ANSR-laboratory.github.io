abstract: Event-related functional MRI (ER-fMRI) based on both blood oxygen level-dependent
  (BOLD) contrast and perfusion contrast has been recently developed to study human  brain
  activation due to brief stimulation. In this report, both BOLD- and  perfusion-based
  ER-fMRI were directly compared using repeated single-trial, short  visual stimulation
  (1 sec) in six human volunteers. The results show that the  cerebral blood flow
  change reached a maximum approximately 1 sec earlier than the  BOLD signal change
  (4.2 +/- 0.2 sec vs. 5.1 +/- 0.2 sec after the stimulation, P  textless 0.05). The
  full width at half maximum of the hemodynamic response measured by  perfusion was
  not significantly different from that measured with BOLD (5.1 +/-  0.6 sec vs. 5.9
  +/- 0.6 sec). A positive linear correlation was found between the  maximum perfusion
  and maximum BOLD signal changes (r = 0. 77, P = 0.07).
