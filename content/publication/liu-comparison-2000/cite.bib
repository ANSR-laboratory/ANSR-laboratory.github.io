 abstract = {Event-related functional MRI (ER-fMRI) based on both blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast and perfusion contrast has been recently developed to study human  brain activation due to brief stimulation. In this report, both BOLD- and  perfusion-based ER-fMRI were directly compared using repeated single-trial, short  visual stimulation (1 sec) in six human volunteers. The results show that the  cerebral blood flow change reached a maximum approximately 1 sec earlier than the  BOLD signal change (4.2 +/- 0.2 sec vs. 5.1 +/- 0.2 sec after the stimulation, P  \textless 0.05). The full width at half maximum of the hemodynamic response measured by  perfusion was not significantly different from that measured with BOLD (5.1 +/-  0.6 sec vs. 5.9 +/- 0.6 sec). A positive linear correlation was found between the  maximum perfusion and maximum BOLD signal changes (r = 0. 77, P = 0.07).},
