 abstract = {The authors measured event-related potentials with a craving manipulation to investigate the neural correlates of drug cue reactivity in 13 adolescents who  are cannabis dependent (CD; ages 14-17). The P300 responses to marijuana (MJ)  pictures (MJ-P300) and control pictures (C-P300) were assessed after handling  neutral objects and again after handling MJ paraphernalia (MJP). Self-reported  drug craving and heart rates also were measured. MJ-P300 were larger than C-P300  (p \textless .001), and both the MJ-P300 and craving increased significantly after  handling MJP (p = .002 and p = .003, respectively), with no association between  the magnitude of craving and MJ-P300. Heart rates were not affected by handling  MJP. The results showed that adolescents who are CD have an attentional bias to  MJ stimuli that increases after handling marijuana paraphernalia. Generally, the  results are consistent with what has been reported for adult heavy chronic  cannabis smokers, although there were some differences that require further  investigation.},
