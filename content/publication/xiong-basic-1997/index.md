abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a technique for studying functional
  processes in the human body in vivo. The important clinical applications of PET  in
  neurosurgery include localization of epileptic foci, diagnosis of brain  tumors,
  preoperative brain mapping, and the study of plasticity of the brain  following
  brain damage. The basic physics and neurosurgical applications of PET  are presented.
