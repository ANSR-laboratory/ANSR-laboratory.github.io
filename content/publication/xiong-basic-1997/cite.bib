 abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is a technique for studying functional processes in the human body in vivo. The important clinical applications of PET  in neurosurgery include localization of epileptic foci, diagnosis of brain  tumors, preoperative brain mapping, and the study of plasticity of the brain  following brain damage. The basic physics and neurosurgical applications of PET  are presented.},
