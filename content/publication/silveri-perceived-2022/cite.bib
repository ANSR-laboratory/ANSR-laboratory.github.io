 abstract = {The brain undergoes substantial structural and functional remodeling during adolescence, including alterations in memory-processing regions influenced by  stress. This study evaluated brain activation using functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) during spatial memory performance using a virtual Morris water  task (MWT) and examined the associations between default mode network (DMN)  activation, task performance, and perceived stress and rejection. Functional  magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at 3 Tesla from 59 (34 female)  adolescents (13-14 years). The NIH Emotion Toolbox was used to measure perceived  stress and rejection. During the MWT, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex showed  greater activation during memory retrieval relative to motor performance.  Templates of brain functional networks from the Human Connectome Project study  were used to extract individual participants' brain network activation strengths  for the retrieval \textgreater motor contrast for two sub-networks of the default mode  network: medial temporal lobe (MTL-DMN) and dorsomedial prefrontal (dMPFC-DMN).  For the MTL-DMN sub-network only, activation was significantly associated with  worse MWT performance (p = .008) and greater perceived stress (p = .008) and  perceived rejection (p = .002). Further, MWT performance was negatively  associated with perceived rejection (p = .007). These findings suggest that  perceived stress and rejection are related to engagement of MTL-DMN during  spatial memory and that engagement of this network impacts performance. These  findings also demonstrate the utility of examining task-related network  activation strength to identify the impact of perceived stress and rejection on  large-scale brain network functioning during adolescence.},
