abstract: Cluster-size tests (CST) based on random field theory have been widely adopted
  in fMRI data analysis to detect brain activation. However, most existing approaches  can
  be used appropriately only when the image is highly smoothed in the spatial  domain.
  Unfortunately, spatial smoothing degrades spatial specificity. Recently,  a threshold-free
  cluster enhancement technique was proposed which does not  require spatial smoothing,
  but this method can be used only for group level  analysis. Advances in imaging
  technology now yield high quality high spatial  resolution imaging data in single
  subjects and an inference approach that retains  the benefits of greater spatial
  resolution is called for. In this work, we  present a new CST with a correction
  for voxelation to address this problem. The  theoretical formulation of the new
  approach based on Gaussian random fields is  developed to estimate statistical significance
  using 3D statistical parametric  maps without assuming spatial smoothness. Simulated
  phantom and resting-state  fMRI experimental data are then used to compare the voxelation-corrected  procedure
  to the widely used standard random field theory. Unlike standard random  field theory
  approaches, which require heavy spatial smoothing, the new approach  has a higher
  sensitivity for localizing activation regions without the  requirement of spatial
  smoothness.
