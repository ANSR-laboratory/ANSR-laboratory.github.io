 abstract = {Cluster-size tests (CST) based on random field theory have been widely adopted in fMRI data analysis to detect brain activation. However, most existing approaches  can be used appropriately only when the image is highly smoothed in the spatial  domain. Unfortunately, spatial smoothing degrades spatial specificity. Recently,  a threshold-free cluster enhancement technique was proposed which does not  require spatial smoothing, but this method can be used only for group level  analysis. Advances in imaging technology now yield high quality high spatial  resolution imaging data in single subjects and an inference approach that retains  the benefits of greater spatial resolution is called for. In this work, we  present a new CST with a correction for voxelation to address this problem. The  theoretical formulation of the new approach based on Gaussian random fields is  developed to estimate statistical significance using 3D statistical parametric  maps without assuming spatial smoothness. Simulated phantom and resting-state  fMRI experimental data are then used to compare the voxelation-corrected  procedure to the widely used standard random field theory. Unlike standard random  field theory approaches, which require heavy spatial smoothing, the new approach  has a higher sensitivity for localizing activation regions without the  requirement of spatial smoothness.},
