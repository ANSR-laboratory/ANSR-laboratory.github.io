abstract: Whole body hyperthermia may produce vasodialation, nausea, and altered cognitive
  function. Animal research has identified brain regions that have important roles  in
  thermoregulation. However, differences in both the cognitive and sweating  abilities
  of humans and animals implicate the need for human research. Positron  emission
  tomography (PET) was used to identify brain regions with altered  activity during
  systemic hyperthermia. Human subjects were studied under cool  (control) conditions
  and during steady-state hyperthermia induced by means of a  liquid-conditioned suit
  perfused with hot water. PET images were obtained by  injecting [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose,
  waiting 20 min for brain uptake, and then  scanning for 10 min. Heating was associated
  with a 23% increase in resting  metabolic rate. Significant increases in cerebral
  metabolic rate occurred in the  hypothalamus, thalamus, corpus callosum, cingulate
  gyrus, and cerebellum. In  contrast, significant decreases occurred in the caudate,
  putamen, insula, and  posterior cingulum. These results are important for understanding
  the mechanisms  responsible for altered cognitive and systemic responses during
  hyperthermia.  Novel regions (e.g., lateral cerebellum) with possible thermoregulatory
  roles  were identified.
