abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The transition to college is associated with increased risk
  of alcohol misuse and a consequent increase in negative, alcohol-related social
  and  health impacts. Traits associated with ongoing brain maturation during this  period,
  including impulsivity in emotional contexts, could contribute to risky  alcohol
  use. METHODS: This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study  examined
  brain network activation strength during an emotional inhibitory control  task (Go-NoGo),
  which required participants to ignore background images with  negative or neutral
  emotional valence during performance. Participants were 60  college freshmen (aged
  18-20 years, 33 women). Survey measures, completed at  baseline and one-year follow-up
  (follow-up n = 52, 29 women), assessed alcohol  misuse alcohol use disorders identification
  test (AUDIT), alcohol/substance use  counseling center assessment of psychological
  symptoms (C-CAPS), and negative  consequences of alcohol use young adult alcohol
  consequences questionnaire  (YAACQ). Measures were examined relative to network
  activation strength, on the  Negative NoGo textgreater Neutral NoGo contrast, of
  four large-scale brain networks  implicated in top-down regulation of cognition
  and attention: right and left  lateral frontoparietal networks (rL-FPN; lL-FPN),
  dorsal attention network (DAN),  and salience network (SN). RESULTS: Activation
  strength of DAN was negatively  associated with scores on the AUDIT (p = 0.013)
  and YAACQ (p = 0.004) at  baseline, and with C-CAPS score at baseline and follow-up
  (p = 0.002; p = 0.005),  and positively associated with accuracy on NoGo trials
  with negative backgrounds  (p = 0.014). Activation strength of rL-FPN was positively
  associated with C-CAPS  score at follow-up (p = 0.003). SN activation strength was
  negatively associated  with accuracy on NoGo trials with negative (p textless 0.001)
  and neutral (p = 0.002)  backgrounds and with the accuracy difference between negative
  versus neutral NoGo  trials (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that
  less engagement of  large-scale brain circuitry that supports top-down attentional
  control,  specifically during negative emotions, is associated with more problematic  drinking
  in emerging adults who attend college. This pattern of network  activation may serve
  as a risk marker for ongoing self-regulation deficits during  negative emotion that
  could increase risk of problematic alcohol use and negative  impacts of drinking.'
