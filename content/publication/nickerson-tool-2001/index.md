abstract: A technique for calculating the uncertainty in the location of an activation
  site in a PET image, without performing repeated measures, is presented. With the  development
  of new fMRI methods for measuring cerebral hemodynamics,  demonstration of the efficacy
  of these techniques will be critical to establish  clinical utility. Comparisons
  with PET are a powerful tool for validating these  new fMRI techniques. In addition
  to the fact that PET techniques are  well-established methods for making physiological
  measurements in vivo, PET  methods are also free of the geometric distortions and
  nonuniform signal-to-noise  artifacts (due to signal dropout) common in fMRI techniques.
  Comparisons reported  previously have been limited by the large number of trials
  acquired in  single-subject fMRI studies and the small number of trials in a PET
  study (due to  the radiation dose to the patient or the interscan delays for tracer
  decay). Our  method calculates both the center of mass (CM) of a predefined region
  of interest  and the uncertainty in the location of the CM using the preimage PET
  data  (sinograms). Results of phantom studies demonstrate that our method is an  unbiased
  measurement equivalent to that of repeated measures with a large number  of images.
  Extension of this technique to estimate the uncertainty in the  location of an activation
  site in a PET statistical parametric map will permit  precise rigorous comparisons
  of PET and fMRI methods in single subjects without  the constraints imposed by the
  relatively small number of PET measurements.
