 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The insula has a well-established role in nicotine dependence and is a node of the salience network, which integrates internal and external  information to guide behavior. Recent findings reveal that internal and external  processing occurs in the ventral anterior insula (vAI) and dorsal anterior insula  (dAI), respectively. Whether vAI/dAI network connectivity differentially reflects  internally generated craving and externally triggered smoking cue reactivity was  tested. METHODS: Thirty-six male and female nicotine-dependent individuals smoked  1 hour before functional magnetic resonance imaging. Baseline craving was  measured, followed by resting-state and smoking cue reactivity scans and then  another assessment of craving. Craving and cue reactivity interactions were  measured by focusing on specific nodes of the salience network: the vAI/dAI and  anterior cingulate cortex. RESULTS: Resting-state vAI/dAI networks overlapped  with the prototypical salience network, yet they possessed distinct patterns,  linking the vAI with nodes of the internally focused default mode network and the  dAI with nodes of the external, goal-related frontoparietal network. Internally  generated baseline craving was associated with enhanced vAI connectivity, whereas  rostral anterior cingulate cortex reactivity to external smoking cues was  associated with greater dAI connectivity. We also found that cue reactivity in  the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was associated with a rise in subjective  cue-induced craving, whereas baseline subjective craving did not influence brain  cue reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that brain reactivity to smoking  cues is associated with a subsequent increase in craving. In addition, separate  insula networks have a role in an individual's vulnerability to internally  related craving and externally triggered cue reactivity, which could guide the  development of new, neurobiologically targeted therapies.},
