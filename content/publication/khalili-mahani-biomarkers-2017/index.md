abstract: A decade of research and development in resting-state functional MRI (RSfMRI)
  has opened new translational and clinical research frontiers. This review aims to  bridge
  between technical and clinical researchers who seek reliable neuroimaging  biomarkers
  for studying drug interactions with the brain. About 85 pharma-RSfMRI  studies using
  BOLD signal (75% of all) or arterial spin labeling (ASL) were  surveyed to investigate
  the acute effects of psychoactive drugs. Experimental  designs and objectives include
  drug fingerprinting dose-response evaluation,  biomarker validation and calibration,
  and translational studies. Common  biomarkers in these studies include functional
  connectivity, graph metrics,  cerebral blood flow and the amplitude and spectrum
  of BOLD fluctuations. Overall,  RSfMRI-derived biomarkers seem to be sensitive to
  spatiotemporal dynamics of drug  interactions with the brain. However, drugs cause
  both central and peripheral  effects, thus exacerbate difficulties related to biological
  confounds, structured  noise from motion and physiological confounds, as well as
  modeling and inference  testing. Currently, these issues are not well explored,
  and heterogeneities in  experimental design, data acquisition and preprocessing
  make comparative or  meta-analysis of existing reports impossible. A unifying collaborative
  framework  for data-sharing and data-mining is thus necessary for investigating
  the  commonalities and differences in biomarker sensitivity and specificity, and  establishing
  guidelines. Multimodal datasets including sham-placebo or active  control sessions
  and repeated measurements of various psychometric,  physiological, metabolic and
  neuroimaging phenotypes are essential for  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling
  and interpretation of the findings. We  provide a list of basic minimum and advanced
  options that can be considered in  design and analyses of future pharma-RSfMRI studies.
