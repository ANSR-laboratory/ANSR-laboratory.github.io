abstract: Decades of neuroscience research has shown that macroscale brain dynamics
  can be reliably decomposed into a subset of large-scale functional networks, but
  the  specific spatial topographies of these networks and the names used to describe  them
  can vary across studies. Such discordance has hampered interpretation and  convergence
  of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we have developed
  the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to examine and report
  spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging  results and sixteen widely
  used functional brain atlases, consistent with  recommended reporting standards
  developed by the Organization for Human Brain  Mapping. The atlases included in
  the toolbox show some topographical convergence  for specific networks, such as
  those labeled as default or visual. Network naming  varies across atlases, particularly
  for networks spanning frontoparietal  association cortices. For this reason, quantitative
  comparison with multiple  atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging
  findings. We provide  several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome
  Project task fMRI  results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to
  illustrate how  researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through
  quantitative  evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a
  convenient  means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to
  determine  the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined  maps
  and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to  incorporate additional
  atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make  it easier for network
  neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a  standardized manner, thus
  aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons  between studies to produce
  interdisciplinary insights.
