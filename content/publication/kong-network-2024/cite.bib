 abstract = {Decades of neuroscience research has shown that macroscale brain dynamics can be reliably decomposed into a subset of large-scale functional networks, but the  specific spatial topographies of these networks and the names used to describe  them can vary across studies. Such discordance has hampered interpretation and  convergence of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we  have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to  examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging  results and sixteen widely used functional brain atlases, consistent with  recommended reporting standards developed by the Organization for Human Brain  Mapping. The atlases included in the toolbox show some topographical convergence  for specific networks, such as those labeled as default or visual. Network naming  varies across atlases, particularly for networks spanning frontoparietal  association cortices. For this reason, quantitative comparison with multiple  atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging findings. We provide  several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome Project task fMRI  results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to illustrate how  researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through quantitative  evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a convenient  means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine  the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined  maps and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to  incorporate additional atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make  it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a  standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons  between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.},
