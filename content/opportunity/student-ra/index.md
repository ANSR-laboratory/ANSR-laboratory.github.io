The Applied Neuroimaging Statistics Research Laboratory (ANSR Lab) at McLean Hospital is seeking motivated undergraduate and graduate students to join our team as Research Assistants. RAs will gain hands-on experience in neuroimaging research, data analysis, and computational methods, contributing to projects at the intersection of neuroscience, psychiatry, and machine learning. Opportunities are available for course credit, volunteer experience, and, in some cases, paid positions (e.g., summer research projects). If youâ€™re passionate about neuroimaging and eager to develop valuable research skills, we encourage you to apply!

Students should reach out directly to Dr. Lisa Nickerson via [email](mailto:lisa_nickerson@hms.harvard.edu).
