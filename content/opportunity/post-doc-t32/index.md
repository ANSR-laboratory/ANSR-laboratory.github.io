NIDA T32 - Drug Abuse & Brain Imaging Training Program

<!--more-->

## NIDA-Sponsored T32 Postdoctoral Research Position
NIDA-sponsored T32 Postdoctoral Research Positions are available for training and research using multi-modal MRI data from large-scale open-access neuroimaging studies to investigate brain structure, function, and physiology in individuals with substance abuse. Our T32 program is in a multidisciplinary, productive, and stimulating environment with excellent research, clinical, preclinical, and training resources.  

ðŸ“„ **[View the Formal Advertisement (PDF)](/files/T32_Postdoc_McLean.pdf)** 

This program is entering its **23rd year** of support and provides training in substance abuse, a wide array of brain imaging technologies (*multi-modal MRI, EEG, polysomnography/sleep, MRS, and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)*), psychiatry, and translational research. Our partnership with the **Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging** at MGH offers training in PET and combined MRI/PET imaging.  

### Available Resources at McLean Hospital:
- Two **Siemens 3T Prisma scanners**
- A **Varian 4T scanner**
- A **Varian 9.4T multi-bore animal scanner** for studying mice, rats, and nonhuman primates  

### Fellowship Details  
Fellowships are available for **2-3 years** for individuals who are **U.S. citizens or permanent residents**. The program offers training in various tracks, including:  
- Clinical research  
- Behavioral pharmacology  
- Functional/physiological imaging technology and analysis  
- Translational research  

Training is **tailored to meet the individual needs** of each Fellow to facilitate transitions to independent scientists. After studying with a preceptor, Fellows will have opportunities to work in various areas to advance their career development.  

Applicants should hold an **M.D., Ph.D., or equivalent degree** in psychology, pharmacology, physics, engineering, neuroscience, or a related field. **Start date is negotiable** and salary is commensurate with the number of years of post-degree training as established by NIH guidelines.
