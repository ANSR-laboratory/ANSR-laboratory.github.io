        The Applied Neuroimaging Statistics Research Laboratory is an academic research group dedicated to improving statistical methodologies for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our research spans multiple domains, including the development of novel computational tools for studying the brain's structural and functional connectome. We leverage state-of-the-art techniques such as multi-modal data fusion and machine learning to address fundamental questions in neuroimaging and to enhance our understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders. 
        
        Our work bridges theory and application, combining methodological innovation with empirical investigations in neuroimaging. By integrating advanced statistical approaches with neurobiological data, we aim to refine how we study brain networks, mental illness, and cognitive function.

        We are based in the <a href="https://www.mcleanmri.org/" target="_blank">McLean Imaging Center</a> at McLean Hospital & the <a href="https://psych.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Psychiatry</a> at Harvard Medical School.
