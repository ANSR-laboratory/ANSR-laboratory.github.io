        ### We develop and apply advanced statistical and machine learning methods to improve neuroimaging analysis and enhance our understanding of brain function in health and disease.

        The Applied Neuroimaging Statistics Research Laboratory is an academic research group dedicated to improving statistical methodologies for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our research spans multiple domains, including the development of novel computational tools for studying the brain's structural and functional connectome. We leverage state-of-the-art techniques such as multi-modal data fusion and machine learning to address fundamental questions in neuroimaging and to enhance our understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders. 
        
        Our work bridges theory and application, combining methodological innovation with empirical investigations in neuroimaging. By integrating advanced statistical approaches with neurobiological data, we aim to refine how we study brain networks, mental illness, and cognitive function.

        We are based in the <a href="https://www.mcleanmri.org/" target="_blank">McLean Imaging Center</a> at McLean Hospital & the <a href="https://psych.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Psychiatry</a> at Harvard Medical School.

        ### Accessibility, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, & Belonging
        At the **ANSR Lab**, we are committed to fostering an inclusive, equitable, and welcoming environment where diverse perspectives drive innovation in neuroimaging and biomedical research.  

        We believe that **scientific discovery flourishes when all voices are heard**, and we actively work to **break down barriers** that have historically excluded underrepresented groups in STEM. Our lab is a space where **collaboration, respect, and belonging** are the foundation of both our research and mentorship.  

        Through **thoughtful mentorship, open science practices, and equitable research opportunities**, we aim to contribute to a scientific community that reflects and serves the diversity of the world around us. We **welcome scholars of all backgrounds** and strive to ensure that **our work promotes knowledge that is accessible, transparent, and impactful for all.**
