        <span style="color:#008ab0;">**Accessibility, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, & Belonging**</span>
        
        At the **ANSR Lab**, we believe that **scientific discovery flourishes when all voices are heard**, and we actively work to **break down barriers** that have historically excluded underrepresented groups in STEM. Our lab is a space where **collaboration, respect, and belonging** are the foundation of both our research and mentorship.  

        Through **thoughtful mentorship, open science practices, and equitable research opportunities**, we aim to contribute to a scientific community that reflects and serves the diversity of the world around us. We **welcome scholars of all backgrounds** and strive to ensure that **our work promotes knowledge that is accessible, transparent, and impactful for all.**
